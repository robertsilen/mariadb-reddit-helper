> So, I’ve been working on this thing called [**DailyPitch**](https://dailypitch.app). I’ll be honest—the last few weeks have been a bit of a blur. If you’ve ever tried to launch something online, you know the feeling. You spend weeks or months staring at a screen, perfecting every pixel, and then you finally put it out there. And then? Usually nothing. Or maybe a few likes from your friends.

I spent way too many nights debugging why the daily reset wasn't firing at midnight UTC. My "minimalist" UI turned into a mess of spaghetti code before I finally stripped it back to what mattered. I’m using Next.js and mariaDB because I wanted to move fast, but even then, the logic for gamifying the growth metrics was a headache.

No comment recommended - This appears to be promotional content for a startup pitch platform called DailyPitch. While the author mentions using MariaDB in their tech stack, this is just a brief mention and they're not seeking any MariaDB-specific help or discussing any database-related issues. The post is primarily focused on promoting their platform and generating discussion about startup marketing strategies rather than addressing any MariaDB technical matters.

**AI suggested comment:** Performance Issue


Thanks for sharing this important analysis on OLTP benchmarking methodologies! As a MariaDB Foundation advocate, I appreciate seeing rigorous discussion about proper performance evaluation practices. The distinction between sysbench-tpcc and real-world OLTP workloads is crucial for anyone making database technology decisions. Your point about hardware relevance is particularly valuable - outdated test environments can lead to misleading conclusions that don't reflect modern deployment scenarios. This kind of methodological transparency helps the entire database community make better informed choices.

This is a great write-up for getting Microweber running with MariaDB! As a MariaDB Foundation advocate, I'm glad to see MariaDB 10.6 working well in your setup. Your Docker Compose configuration looks solid - using the official MariaDB image with proper environment variables is exactly the right approach. 

One small suggestion: if you run into any performance issues later, you might want to consider adding some MariaDB-specific configuration via a custom my.cnf file mounted as a volume, especially for Laravel applications which can benefit from query cache tuning. But for getting started, your current setup should work great!

Thanks for sharing this detailed troubleshooting guide - it'll definitely help others deploying similar Laravel-based applications with MariaDB.

No comment recommended. This is a detailed setup guide for deploying Microweber (a Laravel CMS) using Docker Compose with MariaDB as the database backend. The post is well-structured and helpful to the community, but doesn't contain any MariaDB-specific issues or questions that would warrant a response from the MariaDB Foundation. The author is successfully using MariaDB 10.6 in their setup without any database-related problems.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Technical Support


You might be running into schema or foreign key constraints when adding monitored items directly to the database. The monitor records in Uptime Kuma likely depend on the user and settings being properly initialized through the application first.

I'd recommend sticking with the REST API approach rather than direct database manipulation. Try using the Uptime Kuma API endpoints with proper authentication headers, and make sure you're creating monitors after the initial setup is complete. You can also check the browser's network tab when manually adding monitors to see the exact API calls being made.

For the database writes, ensure you're following the proper sequence - user creation, initial settings, then monitors with correct foreign key relationships.

No comment recommended - While this post mentions MariaDB in passing as part of a Docker Compose setup, it's primarily focused on deploying Microweber CMS on Dokploy platform. The MariaDB configuration shown is basic and standard, with no specific MariaDB issues or questions raised. The technical challenges described are mainly related to PHP, permissions, SSL configuration, and Docker deployment rather than database-specific problems.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion


This looks like a solid setup for your Redmine deployment! For NGINX with your configuration, I'd recommend adding it as a container in your compose.yaml file. This approach offers better portability, easier version management, and keeps your infrastructure as code. You can use volumes to persist NGINX configuration and SSL certificates if needed.

Since you're using MariaDB on the host, make sure your compose network can reach it (you might need to use host networking or ensure proper network connectivity). Also consider if you might want to containerize MariaDB in the future for consistency - it would make your entire stack more portable and easier to manage through Docker Compose.

For 1000 total users, your current approach should handle the load well. Feel free to share more details about any specific MariaDB configuration questions you might have!

This appears to be promotional content for a video discussing MySQL's future and MariaDB as an alternative, referencing Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems. While the topic is relevant to MariaDB advocacy, the premise contains misinformation - Oracle has not stopped maintaining MySQL. As a MariaDB Foundation representative, it would be important to correct this misconception while still highlighting MariaDB's benefits.

Suggested reply: "Thanks for discussing MariaDB! Just a clarification - Oracle hasn't stopped maintaining MySQL, but many users have migrated to MariaDB for its open development model, enhanced features, and storage engines like Aria and ColumnStore. MariaDB remains committed to true open source values with transparent development. Happy to answer any technical questions about MariaDB's advantages!"

**AI suggested comment:** Performance Issue


I notice you mentioned "same database (local)" but haven't specified which database system you're using. If you're using MariaDB/MySQL, the performance issue could be related to database connectivity rather than just PHP/Laravel execution.

Here are some MariaDB-specific things to check:

1. Connection method: Are you connecting via socket on bare metal but TCP in Docker? Socket connections are typically faster.

2. Connection pooling: Docker container might be establishing new DB connections for each request instead of reusing them.

3. Database host resolution: Using 'localhost' in Docker might resolve differently than expected. Try using the actual IP or container name.

4. MariaDB configuration: Check if max_connections, thread_cache_size, or query_cache settings differ between environments.

Try adding database query logging to see if there are connection delays, and consider testing with a simple route that doesn't touch the database at all to isolate whether this is DB-related.

This is a great architectural question for a multi-tenant SaaS POS system! For MariaDB specifically, I'd recommend considering option 3 (JSON fields) as it's actually well-supported in modern MariaDB versions with good indexing capabilities through virtual columns.

However, you might also consider a hybrid approach: keep your core product table with common fields, then use a separate "product_attributes" table with columns like product_id, attribute_name, attribute_value, and business_type. This gives you flexibility without the EAV performance issues since you're not storing everything as EAV.

MariaDB's JSON functions and virtual columns on JSON fields can provide excellent performance for your reporting needs. You could also leverage MariaDB's dynamic columns feature, which is similar to JSON but more structured.

For a system expecting high transaction volume, consider partitioning strategies and ensure you're using InnoDB with appropriate indexing. Would you like specific guidance on MariaDB JSON indexing or partitioning strategies for your use case?

Hi! This sounds like a great project. Just wanted to mention that if you're planning to support MySQL, you might also consider adding MariaDB compatibility since many organizations have migrated or are considering migration. MariaDB maintains strong MySQL compatibility but has some unique features and syntax extensions that would be valuable to include in your diagramming tool. The MariaDB community would definitely benefit from better visualization tools, especially ones that understand MariaDB-specific features like temporal tables, sequence objects, and our extended JSON functions. Would love to hear if MariaDB support is on your roadmap!

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Technical Support


While I can see you're working with MySQL products, I'd like to mention that MariaDB offers excellent alternatives that might work better for your setup. MariaDB Server is a drop-in replacement for MySQL with better performance and more features, and you can use any MySQL-compatible client tools with it, including MySQL Workbench.

For macOS, MariaDB installation is often smoother than MySQL. You can install it easily via Homebrew with "brew install mariadb" or download from mariadb.org. The compatibility warnings you're seeing with MySQL might not be an issue with MariaDB.

If you're required to use MySQL specifically for class, you might want to check your macOS version compatibility with the MySQL versions you're downloading, or consider using Docker to run MySQL in a container which often resolves compatibility issues.

This looks like a Java application packaging question rather than a MariaDB-specific issue. While the user mentions MySQL connector, they're asking about how to package their Java application with dependencies into a JAR file for command-line execution. This is primarily a Java development/build tool question (Maven, Gradle, or manual JAR creation) rather than a database connectivity issue. Since they're using MySQL connector and not MariaDB connector, and the core problem is about Java packaging rather than database functionality, it would be better addressed in Java or general programming communities.

This is a detailed walkthrough of getting Microweber CMS running with MariaDB on Docker. While not specifically a MariaDB question, it's a valuable community contribution showing MariaDB in a real-world deployment scenario. A brief supportive comment acknowledging the contribution and offering MariaDB-specific assistance would be appropriate.

Great detailed walkthrough! It's always helpful to see real-world deployment scenarios with MariaDB. Your Docker Compose setup looks solid - MariaDB 10.6 is a stable choice for this kind of application. If you run into any MariaDB-specific performance tuning needs as your Microweber site grows, or have questions about optimizing the database configuration for your workload, feel free to ask. Thanks for sharing your experience with the community!

Thanks for sharing your detailed Microweber setup with MariaDB! Your Docker Compose configuration looks solid. Just a couple of suggestions from the MariaDB side: Consider upgrading to MariaDB 10.11 or 11.4 (current LTS versions) instead of 10.6 for better performance and security. Also, you might want to add some MariaDB-specific optimizations to your compose file like setting innodb_buffer_pool_size if you're handling larger datasets. The mixed content issues you solved are quite common with Laravel apps behind proxies. Great troubleshooting work overall!

No comment recommended - This is a comprehensive guide about deploying a Laravel-based CMS on Dokploy using Docker Compose with MariaDB. While MariaDB is mentioned as part of the stack, the post doesn't contain any specific MariaDB technical issues, questions, or problems that would benefit from MariaDB Foundation input. The author has successfully resolved their setup and is sharing their solution rather than seeking help.

No comment recommended - This is a general career advice question about backend development specialization that doesn't specifically relate to MariaDB.

This looks like a great resource for SQL learning! I noticed you mention MySQL and PostgreSQL support - have you considered adding MariaDB as well? MariaDB offers excellent compatibility with MySQL while providing additional features like window functions enhancements and improved CTE performance. Many of your exercises would work seamlessly on MariaDB, and it could provide learners exposure to another popular open-source database option. The interactive sandbox approach sounds very practical for hands-on learning.

> Made a collection of SQL questions that let you practice on actual databases instead of just reading solutions.
> 
> Covers the usual suspects:
> 
> * Complex JOINs and self-joins
> * Window functions (RANK, ROW\_NUMBER, etc.)
> * Subqueries vs CTEs
> * Aggregation edge cases
> * Date/time manipulation
> 
> Each question runs on real MySQL or PostgreSQL instances in your browser. No Docker, no local setup - just write queries and see results immediately.
