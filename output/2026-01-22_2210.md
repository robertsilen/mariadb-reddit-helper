Hey! I noticed you're migrating to Uptime Kuma 2.x which switches from SQLite to MariaDB as the embedded database.

The issue here is that those `.db`, `.db-shm`, and `.db-wal` files are **SQLite** database files, not MariaDB. They're completely different database formats - you can't just copy SQLite files into a MariaDB data directory and expect them to work.

Uptime Kuma 2.x should have a built-in migration process that handles converting your SQLite data to MariaDB automatically when you upgrade. Instead of manually copying files, you typically need to:

1. Mount your **old** data volume (containing the SQLite files) to the new container
2. Let Uptime Kuma's migration tool detect and convert the data on first startup

Check the [Uptime Kuma 2.0 migration docs](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki/) for the proper upgrade path - there should be specific instructions for migrating from 1.x to 2.x.

If you do need to manually migrate data between database systems in the future, you'd need to export/import the actual data (not copy raw files), since SQLite and MariaDB store data in completely different formats.

### [r/truenas](https://reddit.com/r/truenas) – [Best practice for ZFS snapshots with running Docker containers?](https://reddit.com/r/truenas/comments/1qjumjv/best_practice_for_zfs_snapshots_with_running/)
2026-01-22 13:32 UTC

> Hi everyone, 
> 
> I'm currently setting up my backup strategy. In your experience, is it necessary to stop docker containers before a snapshot/cloudsync to avoid database corruption for postgres, mariadb, sqlite, etc? 

**AI suggested comment:** **Assessment:** This post is only tangentially relevant to MariaDB - it's primarily about ZFS snapshot strategy with Docker, and MariaDB is just one of several databases mentioned as examples.

**Recommendation:** A brief, helpful comment could be appropriate, but it should be genuinely useful rather than promotional. Here's a suggested response:

---

For MariaDB specifically, you don't necessarily need to stop the container, but you should consider:

1. **Ideal approach**: Use `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` or run `mariadb-backup` before the snapshot to ensure consistency. This is brief and won't cause noticeable downtime.

2. **Without stopping**: ZFS snapshots are atomic, so you'll get a crash-consistent state. InnoDB (MariaDB's default engine) handles crash recovery well, so your snapshot would be recoverable - similar to what would happen after a power failure. Not ideal for critical production, but often acceptable for home setups.

3. **Docker-specific tip**: You can exec into the container to run the flush: `docker exec <container> mariadb -e "FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK"` - just remember to release it after the snapshot.

The other databases mentioned have their own considerations - Postgres has `pg_start_backup()`, SQLite needs less concern if using WAL mode.

---

**Why this approach:**
- Directly answers their question for MariaDB
- Technically accurate and practical
- Doesn't oversell or push MariaDB unnecessarily
- Acknowledges other databases exist (not tribalistic)

Muito legal o projeto! 👏

Fico feliz em ver que o MariaDB já está na lista de databases suportados. Como alguém da MariaDB Foundation, adorei ver ferramentas da comunidade open source incluindo suporte ao MariaDB.

Algumas sugestões/perguntas técnicas:

1. **Qual driver Go você está usando para MariaDB/MySQL?** O `go-sql-driver/mysql` funciona bem com MariaDB, mas existem algumas features específicas do MariaDB (como sequences, system-versioned tables) que podem precisar de tratamento especial.

2. **Já testou com MariaDB 11.x?** Se precisar de um ambiente de teste, posso ajudar a conectar você com recursos da comunidade.

3. Seria interessante adicionar suporte a **MariaDB-specific syntax highlighting** no futuro (CTEs recursivas, window functions, etc.)

Vou dar uma estrela no repositório e testar com MariaDB aqui. Se precisar de qualquer ajuda técnica relacionada ao MariaDB ou quiser divulgar o projeto nos canais da comunidade MariaDB, é só falar!

Parabéns pela iniciativa open source! 🎉

**AI suggested comment:** Here's a suggested comment from a MariaDB Foundation perspective:

---

Great question! Setting up MariaDB for development in NixOS can definitely be tricky at first.

For local development, you have a few options:

**1. Using NixOS services (system-wide)**
If you're on NixOS, you can enable MariaDB in your `configuration.nix`:
```nix
services.mysql = {
  enable = true;
  package = pkgs.mariadb;
};
```

**2. Per-project with devenv.sh**
This is becoming popular in the Nix community - [devenv](https://devenv.sh) makes spinning up services like MariaDB really straightforward:
```nix
services.mysql = {
  enable = true;
  package = pkgs.mariadb;
  initialDatabases = [{ name = "myproject"; }];
};
```

**3. Container approach**
Some folks prefer running MariaDB in a container even on NixOS - you can define this in your flake and use `podman` or `docker` which NixOS supports well.

For your open source contribution question - if the project uses Docker/docker-compose for development, you can usually run those containers on NixOS without issues. Many projects in the MariaDB ecosystem use this approach.

If you run into any MariaDB-specific issues with your Nix setup, feel free to ask on our [Zulip chat](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com/) - we have community members who use NixOS!

**AI suggested comment:** ## Analysis

This post is primarily about **pfSense Captive Portal configuration issues** - specifically a 502 Bad Gateway error during auto-login flow. While MariaDB is mentioned as part of the stack, the user clearly states:

> "As entradas do banco de dados são criadas corretamente" (Database entries are created correctly)

The problem is **not** with MariaDB - it's with pfSense's Captive Portal handling of POST requests for auto-login.

## Recommendation

**I would NOT comment on this post** as a MariaDB advocate because:

1. **MariaDB is working correctly** - the user confirms data is being saved properly to radcheck, radusergroup, and radpostauth tables
2. **The actual problem** is pfSense Captive Portal returning 502 errors during the PHP auto-login POST request
3. **Adding a MariaDB comment would be off-topic** and could come across as opportunistic/spammy rather than helpful
4. **No MariaDB expertise is needed** to solve this user's problem

## If I absolutely had to engage

If there were a community guideline requiring engagement, I might offer something minimal like:

> "Glad to see MariaDB is working well for your RADIUS backend! Since the database operations are completing successfully, this looks like a pfSense Captive Portal issue rather than a database problem. You might get better help in r/PFSENSE or the Netgate forums. Good luck!"

But honestly, **the best action is to skip this post** and look for threads where MariaDB expertise would actually add value.

Interesting project! As someone from the MariaDB Foundation, I wanted to chime in on the database side since you mentioned MySQL.

Given the scope of what you're building (jobs, dating, marketplace, bookings, chat, etc.), you might want to consider **MariaDB** as a drop-in replacement. A few reasons why it could be relevant for your use case:

1. **It's MySQL-compatible** - your existing code should work with minimal changes
2. **Better performance for mixed workloads** - with so many different features, you'll have a mix of read-heavy (feeds, listings) and write-heavy (chat, bookings) operations
3. **Truly open source** - MariaDB Foundation ensures it stays community-driven, which matters for a startup watching licensing costs as you scale

For a super app handling this many services in one DB, you'll eventually hit scaling challenges. MariaDB's thread pool and query optimizer improvements over MySQL can help, especially when you're expanding city by city.

That said, the honest technical feedback: your bigger challenge won't be MySQL vs MariaDB - it'll be **data architecture**. With this many services, think carefully about whether a single monolithic database makes sense or if you need service-specific databases early on.

Happy to answer any database-related questions if you run into scaling issues!

2026-01-22 18:59 UTC

**AI suggested comment:** I would advise against commenting on this post for several reasons:

1. **Language barrier**: The post is in Spanish ("Generación de Certificados y Diplomas con PHP, MySql y JS" = "Generation of Certificates and Diplomas with PHP, MySQL and JS"), and as a MariaDB advocate, I'd want to ensure clear technical communication.

2. **Generic MySQL mention**: The post mentions "MySql" generically - it's likely just referring to the MySQL ecosystem broadly, not specifically asking about database choices or having a database-related problem.

3. **No apparent problem to solve**: The title suggests this is likely a tutorial, showcase, or project share rather than someone seeking help with a database issue.

4. **Could appear spammy**: Jumping in to promote MariaDB on a post that isn't asking for database recommendations or experiencing MySQL-specific issues could come across as unwelcome marketing rather than genuine community help.

**If I were to comment**, it would only be appropriate if:
- The actual post content reveals a specific database problem
- They're asking for database recommendations
- There's a performance or compatibility issue where MariaDB's features could genuinely help

**A potentially relevant soft comment (if appropriate based on full content):**
> "¡Buen proyecto! Si estás usando MySQL, MariaDB es un drop-in replacement compatible que podrías considerar. La comunidad es muy activa si tienes preguntas técnicas."

But I'd recommend **skipping this one** and looking for posts with actual technical problems to solve.

**AI suggested comment:** Looking at this post, I need to assess if there's a relevant MariaDB angle to comment on.

**Analysis:**

The user mentions "mysql" in the title and is using Prisma ORM with what they describe as "an existing database." The error they're encountering (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findMany')`) is actually a **Prisma client generation/configuration issue**, not a database connectivity problem. The warning about module types also points to a Node.js/JavaScript configuration issue.

**Potential MariaDB-relevant comment:**

---

Hi! Just wanted to check - when you mention MySQL, are you actually using MySQL or MariaDB? Many people use the terms interchangeably, but if you're running MariaDB, it's worth knowing that Prisma officially supports it with the `mysql` connector.

That said, the specific error you're seeing (`Cannot read properties of undefined`) is happening before any database connection is attempted - it's a Prisma client generation issue. A few things to check:

1. Make sure you've run `npx prisma generate` after defining your schema
2. Verify your `schema.prisma` has a model named `test` (case-sensitive)
3. Check that you're importing PrismaClient correctly

If you *are* using MariaDB and run into any database-specific quirks once you get past this setup issue, feel free to ask - there are occasional differences in how certain features work compared to MySQL.

---

**My assessment:** This is a borderline case. The core problem is JavaScript/Prisma configuration, not database-related. I could offer the comment above to be helpful while gently checking if MariaDB is involved, but I should be careful not to force a MariaDB angle where it isn't relevant. The comment stays helpful without being pushy about MariaDB.

**AI suggested comment:** Here's a relevant comment I could add as a MariaDB community advocate:

---

Hey! If you're open to it, MariaDB (a MySQL-compatible fork) might actually handle this use case really well. A few suggestions:

1. **MariaDB has native JSON functions** that are fully compatible with MySQL's, so your existing approach would work seamlessly.

2. For large JSON imports, you might want to consider using **`LOAD DATA INFILE`** which is significantly faster than individual INSERT statements - you could preprocess your JSON into CSV format first.

3. If you're hitting memory limits with PHP, consider:
   - Processing the JSON in chunks using a streaming JSON parser
   - Using **MariaDB's `CONNECT` storage engine** which can actually read JSON files directly as tables - this is a MariaDB-specific feature that could eliminate the PHP middleman entirely!

4. For batch inserts, use multi-row INSERT syntax or prepared statements with transactions to reduce overhead.

If you share more details about your JSON structure and what you're trying to accomplish, I'd be happy to help further. Also, what version of MySQL/MariaDB are you using? Some newer features might simplify your workflow.

**AI suggested comment:** Here's a relevant comment you could add as a MariaDB community advocate:

**Comment:**

Hey! MariaDB community member here - this is actually a great use case where MariaDB has some features that could help you out.

A few suggestions:

1. **MariaDB's CONNECT storage engine** can read JSON files directly as virtual tables without loading everything into PHP memory first. You could potentially query the JSON file directly or use it to stream data into a regular table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE json_source (
    -- define your columns here
) ENGINE=CONNECT TABLE_TYPE=JSON FILE_NAME='/path/to/your/file.json';

INSERT INTO your_actual_table SELECT * FROM json_source;
```

2. **For the PHP streaming approach** others mentioned, MariaDB handles bulk inserts very efficiently. Consider using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` if you can convert to CSV first, or batch your INSERTs in transactions of 1000-5000 rows - MariaDB's InnoDB handles this really well.

3. If this is a recurring task (sounds like that government file gets updated?), you might also look into **mariadb-import** (the command-line tool) for automation.

The real solution to your memory issue is definitely streaming the JSON in PHP (JsonMachine library is excellent for this), but MariaDB's CONNECT engine is worth exploring since it offloads the parsing entirely.

Happy to help if you hit any MariaDB-specific issues!

**AI suggested comment:** I would recommend **not commenting** on this post.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Wrong context** - This is an automated package library announcement in r/PDQDeploy, a subreddit for IT deployment software. It's simply notifying admins that MySQL Workbench 8.0.46 is available for deployment.

2. **No technical problem or discussion** - There's no question being asked, no issue to solve, and no conversation happening. It's purely informational/automated.

3. **Would appear spammy** - Commenting to promote MariaDB tools (like DBeaver compatibility, HeidiSQL, or MariaDB's own offerings) on an unrelated deployment notification would come across as opportunistic marketing rather than helpful community engagement.

4. **Not the right audience** - PDQ Deploy users are packaging software for enterprise deployment, not choosing between database platforms.

**Better approach:** Wait for posts where users are:
- Asking about MySQL vs MariaDB differences
- Experiencing MySQL/MariaDB technical issues
- Discussing database migration
- Seeking recommendations for database tools

Those contexts provide genuine opportunities for helpful, welcomed community engagement.

### [r/HowToHack](https://reddit.com/r/HowToHack) – [Stuck at a scenario having Joomla](https://reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/1qjyohx/stuck_at_a_scenario_having_joomla/)
2026-01-22 16:12 UTC

> The scenario has a Joomla of version 2.4.7 which is vulnerable to CVE-2023-23752
> 
> Which gives you the database details. I got those details but the mysql isn't accessible
> It gives an error while connecting to the mysql
> 
> ERROR 2026 (HY000): TLS/SSL error: SSL is required, but  the server does not support it
> 
> And when I am doing --skip-ssl, it says 
> Access denied for user

**AI suggested comment:** Based on this post, I would **not recommend commenting** as a MariaDB Foundation advocate. Here's my reasoning:

## Why to Avoid This Post

**1. Security/Ethical Concerns**
The user is explicitly discussing exploiting CVE-2023-23752 (a Joomla authentication bypass vulnerability) to obtain database credentials. This appears to be either:
- A CTF/hacking challenge ("scenario" suggests this)
- Potentially unauthorized access to a system

**2. Not a MariaDB Technical Issue**
The actual problems are:
- SSL/TLS configuration mismatch
- Credential authentication failure
- These stem from the exploitation context, not a MariaDB bug or feature question

**3. Reputational Risk**
Commenting as a MariaDB Foundation representative on a post about exploiting vulnerabilities to access databases could reflect poorly on the organization, even if the advice is purely technical.

---

## If You Still Wanted to Engage (Not Recommended)

If this were a *legitimate* SSL connection question in a different context, a helpful comment might cover:
- MariaDB's `--ssl` vs `--skip-ssl` client options
- Server-side `require_secure_transport` settings
- How `mysql_native_password` vs `caching_sha2_password` interacts with SSL requirements

But given the context, **I'd suggest skipping this one** and looking for posts where users have genuine MariaDB configuration, performance, or migration questions.

**AI suggested comment:** I would not recommend commenting on this post at all.

This is a spam post advertising academic cheating services - offering to take exams, write papers, and complete coursework fraudulently for students. It has absolutely no connection to MariaDB, databases, or any technical topic.

As a MariaDB community advocate, engaging with this post would be inappropriate because:

1. **It's completely off-topic** - There's no MariaDB or database question to address
2. **It promotes unethical behavior** - Academic fraud undermines education
3. **It's spam** - Commenting could appear to legitimize the post
4. **Reputational risk** - Any association with this content would reflect poorly on MariaDB Foundation

**The appropriate action** would be to report the post as spam and move on to find legitimate technical discussions where MariaDB expertise would be helpful and welcomed.

**AI suggested comment:** I would not recommend commenting on this post. Here's why:

**This post is completely irrelevant to MariaDB.** It's spam advertising academic cheating services - paying others to take exams, write papers, and complete coursework fraudulently.

**As a MariaDB Foundation representative, commenting would be inappropriate because:**

1. **No technical connection** - There's no MariaDB, MySQL, or database-related content to address
2. **Reputational risk** - Engaging with academic fraud spam could reflect poorly on the MariaDB Foundation
3. **Off-mission** - This doesn't serve the goal of helping users with legitimate MariaDB technical problems
4. **Spam amplification** - Any engagement could increase visibility of harmful content

**The appropriate action would be to:**
- Report the post as spam
- Skip it entirely and look for legitimate technical discussions where MariaDB expertise would be valuable

I'd recommend focusing on posts where users have genuine database questions, migration challenges, performance issues, or are comparing MariaDB with other solutions - places where helpful technical commentary builds community trust and supports the MariaDB ecosystem.

**AI suggested comment:** ## Suggested Comment:

While your question is focused on FileMaker Server, I noticed you mentioned an unrelated MySQL server in your environment. If you ever consider alternatives or have database components that could be separated out, MariaDB might be worth exploring - it's a drop-in replacement for MySQL with some performance improvements and is fully open source under GPL.

On your actual VM question though - for database workloads in general (which applies somewhat to FileMaker's underlying data handling):

1. **I/O is almost always the bottleneck** for database servers, especially in virtualized environments. The NVMe vs SATA SSD difference is very noticeable for database workloads with lots of random reads/writes. If your provider offers NVMe-backed storage, it's usually worth the premium for database VMs.

2. **RAM matters more than raw CPU speed** for most database scenarios. That 32GB you currently have is likely more important than the CPU cores for caching frequently accessed data.

3. **Ask your provider about "noisy neighbor" isolation** - in shared VM environments, inconsistent I/O performance from other tenants can cause issues that are hard to diagnose.

4. **Request IOPS guarantees**, not just storage size. A 1TB allocation means nothing if you're throttled to 3,000 IOPS.

The move from bare metal to VM is very doable - just make sure you're getting dedicated/guaranteed resources rather than "burstable" allocations for a production database workload.

*This comment provides genuine technical value while naturally mentioning MariaDB as an alternative without being pushy or off-topic.*

**AI suggested comment:** I would not recommend commenting on this post. Here's why:

**This post is completely unrelated to MariaDB or databases.** It's spam advertising academic cheating services - offering to take exams, write papers, and complete coursework for students fraudulently.

**As a MariaDB Foundation representative, you should:**

1. **Not engage** - This post has zero technical relevance to MariaDB, MySQL, databases, or any related technology
2. **Report the post** - This is spam that violates most subreddit rules and Reddit's terms of service
3. **Protect your professional reputation** - Any comment here would be inappropriate and could reflect poorly on the MariaDB Foundation

**The only appropriate actions are:**
- Report the post as spam
- Move on to find legitimate technical discussions where MariaDB expertise would be valuable

If you're looking for opportunities to engage as a MariaDB advocate, I'd suggest searching for posts about:
- Database performance issues
- MySQL vs MariaDB comparisons
- SQL optimization questions
- Open source database discussions
- Migration questions between database systems

Would you like help identifying more appropriate posts to engage with?

**AI suggested comment:** Here's a relevant comment you could add as a MariaDB Foundation community advocate:

**Comment suggestion:**

Interesting project! As someone from the MariaDB community, I wanted to offer a perspective on your database considerations.

While Supabase/Postgres is certainly capable, since you're coming from a MySQL background, you might find MariaDB worth evaluating for this rebuild—especially for game-specific features:

- **Temporal Tables** (system-versioned tables) are built-in and could be valuable for game audit trails, tracking player stat history, or investigating disputes/cheating
- **Event Scheduler** handles your timed game loops natively (energy regen, jail countdowns, interest payouts) without needing external cron setups
- **Sequences** and **Window Functions** work great for leaderboards and ranking systems
- The **query syntax you already know** from MySQL transfers directly

For the server-side trust issue you mentioned—that's really about your application architecture more than the database choice. Whether you go Postgres or MariaDB, you'll want that game logic in stored procedures or a proper backend layer, not client-side.

MariaDB can be self-hosted (full control) or you could look at SkySQL if you want managed hosting. Either way, your existing MySQL schema would migrate with minimal friction.

Not saying Supabase is wrong for this—just that you have options, and your MySQL experience is still valuable if you want to leverage it!

Happy to answer any MariaDB-specific questions if you explore that route.

This comment is helpful because it:
- Offers genuine technical value relevant to their use case
- Doesn't bash their current choice
- Highlights MariaDB-specific features relevant to game development
- Leverages their existing MySQL familiarity
- Stays helpful rather than salesy

>  *Why networking matters*
> - Every attack travels through a network
> - You fail faster without this knowledge
> - Most security tools rely on packets and ports
> 
> *Internet flow in simple steps*
> - You type a website
> - DNS resolves domain to IP
> - Browser opens a connection
> - Server sends response
> - Page loads
> 
> *IP address*
> - Unique identifier for a device
> - IPv4 example: 192.168.0.10
> - IPv6 exists due to IP shortage
> 
> *Public vs private IP*
> - Public IP faces the internet
> - Private IP stays inside network
> - Private ranges:
>     - 192.168.x.x
>     - 10.x.x.x
>     - 172.16.x.x
> 
> *DNS*
> - Phonebook of the internet
> - Converts name to IP
> - Attack angle: DNS spoofing
> 
> *HTTP vs HTTPS*
> - HTTP sends data in plain text
> - HTTPS encrypts data
> - HTTPS uses SSL/TLS
> - Always secure login pages
> 
> *Ports*
> - Logical entry points
> - One IP hosts many services
> - Common ports:

>     - 443: HTTPS
>     - 3306: MySQL
> 
> *TCP vs UDP*
> - TCP: Reliable, used for web, email
> - UDP: Faster, used for video, gaming
> 
> *Packets*

**AI suggested comment:** **Assessment:** This post is a general cybersecurity/networking fundamentals guide. The only tangential MariaDB connection is the mention of port 3306 labeled as "MySQL."

**Recommendation:** **Do not comment.**

Here's why:

1. **Forced relevance** - Jumping in to say "Actually, 3306 is also used by MariaDB!" would come across as pedantic and promotional rather than helpful
2. **Off-topic** - The post is about networking basics for security learners, not database administration or selection
3. **Community perception** - As a MariaDB advocate, commenting here would likely be seen as opportunistic brand insertion rather than genuine contribution
4. **No problem to solve** - There's no question being asked, no misconception about databases to correct, and no user struggling with a MariaDB-related issue

**Better opportunities to watch for:**
- Posts asking about database security hardening
- Questions about MySQL vs MariaDB differences
- Database connection/networking troubleshooting
- Performance or replication questions where you can offer genuine expertise

Sometimes the best advocacy is knowing when *not* to insert yourself into a conversation.

**AI suggested comment:** I would not recommend commenting on this post at all.

This is clearly a spam post advertising academic cheating services (paying someone to take exams, write papers, bypass proctoring software, etc.). It has no connection whatsoever to MariaDB or database technology.

As a MariaDB Foundation representative, engaging with this post would be inappropriate because:

1. **It's off-topic** - There's nothing related to MariaDB, databases, or even legitimate technology questions
2. **It promotes unethical services** - Academic fraud and cheating
3. **It's spam** - This should be reported to subreddit moderators, not engaged with
4. **Brand association risk** - Any comment could inadvertently associate MariaDB with this type of content

**Appropriate action:** Report the post as spam to Reddit moderators and move on to find legitimate technical discussions where MariaDB expertise would be valuable and welcome.

If you're looking for posts to engage with as a MariaDB advocate, I'd suggest searching for posts about:
- Database selection/comparison questions
- MySQL migration discussions
- SQL performance issues
- Open source database topics
- Data storage architecture questions

> No último ano, comecei a aprender golang por conta própria (principalmente usando [esse curso](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang) no começo, e me apaixonei pela linguagem e pelo ferramental por trás dela.

>

> O pam funciona como se fosse uma biblioteca de queries: você consegue salvar e editar suas queries com comandos de terminal, e depois rodar eleas chamando pelo nome ou id. A edição é sempre feita pelo $EDITOR que vai ser definido pelo usuário, e o programa só vai "roubar" a tela do seu terminal quando tiver exibindo os resultados das queries. Aqui em cima coloquei um gif de um fluxo padrão pra salvar e rodar as queries, visualizar os resultados, editar e deletar valores pela tabela e exportar uma seleção dos resultados. A ideia é fugir um pouco do padrão que é usado hoje na maioria dessas ferramentas (aquele design clássico com 3 seções - editor, resultados e listagem dos bancos) e tentar algo mais simples.

**AI suggested comment:** ## Analysis

This is a Portuguese-language post from a developer who created an open-source terminal-based SQL database client called "pam" (similar to DBeaver but for CLI). Key points:

- Written in Go
- Already supports **MySQL/MariaDB** along with PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, SQL Server, and ClickHouse
- Beta version, actively seeking feedback
- Looking for feature suggestions and database support requests

## Suggested Comment

Since the post is in Portuguese and the community is Brazilian, I'd respond in Portuguese:

---

Muito legal o projeto, Eduardo! 👏

Como alguém da comunidade MariaDB, fico feliz em ver que você já incluiu suporte para MySQL/MariaDB. Algumas sugestões que podem ser úteis:

1. **Funcionalidades específicas do MariaDB** - Se quiser diferenciar o suporte MariaDB do MySQL, considere adicionar suporte para features específicas como sequences, system-versioned tables, ou o engine ColumnStore para analytics.

2. **Conexão via socket** - Muitos usuários MariaDB em Linux preferem conectar via Unix socket ao invés de TCP. Isso já está funcionando?

3. **Documentação** - Se precisar de ajuda técnica ou quiser divulgar o projeto na comunidade MariaDB, posso ajudar a conectar você com os recursos certos.

Parabéns pela iniciativa open source! Vou testar e deixar feedback no GitHub. 🚀

This comment offers genuine value, builds community relationships, and subtly promotes MariaDB-specific features without being pushy.

**AI suggested comment:** I would not recommend commenting on this post at all.

**Reasons:**

1. **Completely off-topic** - This post is spam advertising academic cheating services (taking exams for students, writing papers, bypassing proctoring software). It has absolutely nothing to do with MariaDB, databases, or any technology the MariaDB Foundation would be involved with.

2. **Spam/Scam content** - This is clearly a commercial spam post promoting academic dishonesty services. Engaging with it in any way would be inappropriate.

3. **Reputational risk** - As a MariaDB Foundation representative, commenting on this post could associate the Foundation with academic fraud services, which would be damaging to MariaDB's reputation.

4. **No legitimate connection** - While the post mentions "MySQL" buried in its massive keyword list, there's no genuine technical question or discussion about databases that would warrant a response.

**Recommended action:** Report the post as spam rather than engage with it. This type of content violates Reddit's terms of service and most subreddit rules.

Would you like me to help identify posts that would actually be appropriate for MariaDB community engagement instead?

2026-01-22 10:41 UTC

> Microsoft foca-se na estabilidade com a atualização de janeiro de 2026 para o Azure Database for MySQL\
> \
> 🔗 https://tugatech.com.pt/t77301-microsoft-foca-se-na-estabilidade-com-a-atualizacao-de-janeiro-de-2026-para-o-azure-database-for-mysql

**AI suggested comment:** ## Analysis

This post is in Portuguese and discusses Microsoft's January 2026 stability update for Azure Database for MySQL. It's essentially a news item about a MySQL cloud service from Microsoft.

## Recommendation: **Skip this post**

**Reasons not to comment:**

1. **Language barrier** - The post is in Portuguese, and a comment in English might seem out of place or less engaging for the community
2. **Off-topic for MariaDB advocacy** - This is specifically about Azure's MySQL service, not a user asking for help or comparing databases
3. **Could appear as unwanted promotion** - Jumping into a MySQL news post to promote MariaDB would likely be seen as spammy/opportunistic rather than helpful
4. **No technical problem to solve** - There's no question or issue being discussed where MariaDB expertise would add value

---

## If you still want to engage (low priority)

A very subtle, non-promotional comment could be:

> "Interessante ver o foco em estabilidade. Para quem usa MySQL on-premises e considera alternativas, vale lembrar que MariaDB também oferece opções de cloud gerenciado e mantém forte compatibilidade. Alguém aqui já comparou as duas opções no Azure ecosystem?"

But honestly, **I'd recommend saving your engagement for posts where users have actual problems or are actively seeking database recommendations.** This would be a better use of your advocacy efforts.

**AI suggested comment:** I would not recommend commenting on this post at all.

This is spam advertising academic cheating services - it's promoting exam fraud, academic dishonesty, and potentially illegal activities like identity fraud and bypassing security software.

As a MariaDB Foundation representative, you should:

1. **Report the post** to Reddit moderators for spam/fraud
2. **Not engage** with this content in any way that could associate MariaDB with it
3. **Avoid commenting** - there is no legitimate technical discussion here, and any comment could appear as tacit endorsement or could be used to make the spam post seem more legitimate

This post has zero relevance to MariaDB, databases, or any legitimate technical topic. It's purely a cheating-for-hire advertisement.

The only appropriate action is to report and move on.

**AI suggested comment:** I would not recommend commenting on this post. Here's why:

**This is spam/scam content promoting academic dishonesty services** - it's advertising cheating services for exams, hiring people to take tests, bypassing proctoring software, etc.

**As a MariaDB Foundation representative, you should not:**

1. **Engage with this content at all** - It has zero relevance to MariaDB or databases
2. **Provide any legitimacy** - Even a critical comment gives the post engagement
3. **Associate the MariaDB brand** - with academic fraud services

**The appropriate action would be:**
- Report the post as spam/scam to Reddit moderators
- Move on without commenting

If you're looking for genuine opportunities to represent MariaDB, I'd suggest focusing on posts that actually discuss:
- Database selection/comparison questions
- MySQL migration topics
- SQL performance issues
- Open source database discussions
- Technical problems where MariaDB expertise would be helpful

Would you like help identifying the types of legitimate posts that would be appropriate for MariaDB community engagement?

**AI suggested comment:** I would not recommend commenting on this post at all.

**Reasons:**

1. **This is spam/scam content** - The post is advertising academic cheating services, which is unethical and likely violates Reddit's terms of service as well as academic integrity policies at educational institutions.

2. **No MariaDB relevance** - Despite the extensive list of topics and software mentioned (including MySQL and SQL in passing), this post has absolutely nothing to do with MariaDB, databases, or legitimate technical discussion.

3. **Reputational risk** - As a MariaDB Foundation representative, engaging with this content in any way could reflect poorly on the organization. Even commenting to point out that MariaDB isn't relevant could give the spam post more visibility.

4. **Report instead** - The appropriate action would be to report this post as spam/scam to Reddit moderators, not to engage with it.

**Best course of action:** Skip this post entirely and focus on finding legitimate technical discussions where MariaDB expertise would be genuinely helpful to the community.

### [r/AZURE](https://reddit.com/r/AZURE) – [New Azure Database for MySQL servers to receive automatic January 2026 updates](https://reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1qjpl6q/new_azure_database_for_mysql_servers_to_receive/)
2026-01-22 08:56 UTC

> Teams using Azure Private Link and Geo-backups see major improvements in the latest January stability update for MySQL Flexible Servers.

**AI suggested comment:** As a MariaDB Foundation community advocate, I would **not recommend commenting on this post** for the following reasons:

## Why This Isn't a Good Fit

1. **It's a straightforward Azure MySQL announcement** - There's no problem being discussed, no complaints, and no users asking for alternatives

2. **No natural opening for MariaDB** - The post is informational about Azure service updates (Private Link, Geo-backups), not a discussion about MySQL limitations or migration considerations

3. **Could appear opportunistic/spammy** - Jumping into a routine update announcement to promote MariaDB would likely be perceived negatively by the community and could harm MariaDB's reputation

## When I *Would* Comment

I'd look for posts where:
- Users express frustration with MySQL licensing, Oracle ownership concerns, or feature limitations
- Someone asks about MySQL alternatives or comparisons
- There are questions about open-source database options
- Users discuss migration challenges or vendor lock-in concerns
- Technical problems that MariaDB specifically solves better

## Better Approach

Monitor the comments section - if users start discussing concerns about Azure lock-in, MySQL's direction under Oracle, or asking about self-hosted alternatives, *that* would be an appropriate moment to provide helpful information about MariaDB as a drop-in compatible option.

Would you like me to suggest what a comment might look like if such a discussion did emerge?

**AI suggested comment:** I would not recommend commenting on this post at all.

**Reasons:**

1. **This is spam/scam content** - The post is advertising academic cheating services, which is unethical and likely violates most institutions' academic integrity policies.

2. **No MariaDB relevance** - Despite mentioning "MySQL" and "SQL" buried in their long list of services, this post has absolutely nothing to do with MariaDB, databases, or legitimate technical discussion.

3. **Reputational risk** - As a MariaDB Foundation representative, engaging with this content in any way could associate the MariaDB brand with academic dishonesty services.

4. **Proper action** - The appropriate response would be to report this post as spam to Reddit moderators, not to comment on it.

**If you're looking for posts to engage with as a MariaDB advocate, I'd suggest searching for:**
- Genuine questions about MySQL vs MariaDB
- Database performance issues
- Migration questions
- SQL troubleshooting
- Open source database discussions

Would you like help identifying the types of legitimate posts that would be appropriate for MariaDB community engagement?

2026-01-21 21:15 UTC

> En el artículo, se abordan las **razones para dejar de usar MySQL**, destacando la falta de confianza en Oracle como administrador de proyectos de código abierto. El autor menciona que **MySQL ha perdido su atractivo** debido a problemas de rendimiento y escalabilidad, así como a la falta de características modernas que ofrecen otras bases de datos. Además, se discuten las **alternativas a MySQL**, como PostgreSQL y MariaDB, que brindan mejor soporte y características más avanzadas. Finalmente, se concluye que **la comunidad debe considerar otras opciones** para evitar los problemas asociados con MySQL y Oracle. **[https://optimizedbyotto.com/post/reasons-to-stop-using-mysql/#this-is-not-surprising--oracle-should-not-be-trusted-as-the-steward-for-open-source-projects]**

¡Hola! Trabajo en la MariaDB Foundation y me alegra ver este tipo de discusiones.

Algunos puntos que puedo aportar desde la perspectiva de MariaDB:

**Sobre la gobernanza abierta:** Una de las razones por las que MariaDB se creó fue precisamente la preocupación por el futuro de MySQL bajo Oracle. La MariaDB Foundation existe específicamente para garantizar que el proyecto se mantenga abierto y dirigido por la comunidad, no por intereses corporativos únicos.

**Sobre compatibilidad:** Para quienes están considerando migrar desde MySQL, MariaDB mantiene alta compatibilidad - en muchos casos la migración es bastante directa (aunque siempre recomiendo probar en un entorno de desarrollo primero).

**Sobre las características mencionadas:** MariaDB ha añadido funcionalidades que MySQL no tiene, como motores de almacenamiento adicionales (Aria, ColumnStore), mejor optimizador de consultas, y características como CTEs recursivas y window functions que se implementaron antes que en MySQL.

¿Tienen preguntas específicas sobre MariaDB o sobre migración desde MySQL? Con gusto ayudo.

## Why this approach works:

- **Helpful, not salesy** - Ofrece información técnica real
- **Acknowledges the conversation** - No ignora PostgreSQL como alternativa
- **Invites dialogue** - Abre la puerta a preguntas
- **Matches language** - Responde en español como el post original
- **Transparent about affiliation** - Declara la conexión con MariaDB Foundation

> Mine was when I saw a stack trace on a PHP site that said "using password: YES" when connecting to a MySQL database and thought it was a weak password being exposed. I reported it along with other bugs, the site owner fixed those but didn't point out the password wasn't actually YES, and then I read the forum of a different web host a year later and realized \`(using password: YES)\` means you authenticated into the database successfully.

**AI suggested comment:** I'd recommend **not commenting** on this post as a MariaDB Foundation advocate. Here's why:

**Why this isn't a good fit:**

1. **No technical problem to solve** - This is a humorous "share your embarrassing moments" thread, not someone seeking help or discussing database issues

2. **Risk of appearing tone-deaf** - Jumping in with "Actually, in MariaDB..." on a lighthearted confession thread would come across as corporate/promotional and out of touch with the community vibe

3. **No MariaDB angle** - The post is about misreading a PHP/MySQL error message, not about database selection, performance, features, or anything where MariaDB expertise adds value

4. **Could backfire** - Inserting MariaDB into an unrelated conversation could generate negative sentiment toward the foundation

**If you really wanted to engage (not recommended):**

At most, you could upvote and move on, or leave a brief, genuinely human comment like "Ha, we've all been there!" without any MariaDB mention. But even that doesn't serve your advocacy goals.

**Better use of your time:**

Look for posts where people are:
- Asking about MySQL vs MariaDB differences
- Having actual MariaDB technical issues
- Discussing database migrations
- Evaluating open-source database options

Would you like help identifying what types of posts *would* be good opportunities?

**Suggested Comment:**

Hey, MariaDB Foundation community advocate here. I appreciate the sentiment, but I'd encourage a more nuanced take.

While it's true that MySQL has moved to a more restrictive licensing model under Oracle, the decision to switch databases should really be driven by your specific technical needs, not just licensing concerns.

That said, if you're evaluating alternatives, MariaDB was forked from MySQL back in 2009 specifically to ensure a community-driven, truly open-source alternative would always exist. We maintain wire-protocol compatibility with MySQL for most use cases, so migration is often straightforward.

A few things worth mentioning:
- MariaDB Foundation is a non-profit that ensures the server code remains open source under GPL
- We have an active community contributing to development
- For most MySQL workloads, it's close to a drop-in replacement

However, I'd also say - pick the right tool for your job. PostgreSQL is excellent, SQLite has its place, and there are valid reasons to use any of them depending on your requirements.

Happy to answer any technical questions if folks are considering a migration or just want to understand the differences.

**Why this approach:**
- Transparent about affiliation (builds trust)
- Not overly aggressive or sales-y
- Acknowledges the post's point without being inflammatory
- Provides helpful technical context
- Invites engagement without pushing too hard

**AI suggested comment:** As a MariaDB Foundation community advocate, here's a relevant comment I could add:

---

Great to see interest in learning backend web development! Just wanted to mention that **MariaDB** is a fantastic alternative to MySQL that's worth considering as you learn.

MariaDB was created by the original founders of MySQL and is designed to be a drop-in replacement, so all the MySQL concepts and syntax you learn will apply directly. Many popular platforms like Wikipedia, Google, and major Linux distributions have switched to MariaDB as their default.

**Why consider MariaDB as a learner:**
- 100% open source and community-driven
- Same commands and tools work (mysql client, PHP's mysqli/PDO)
- Often better performance out of the box
- Very active community for support

Most PHP tutorials teaching "MySQL" will work identically with MariaDB - just install MariaDB instead and you're good to go!

If anyone wants to try it out, check out [mariadb.org](https://mariadb.org) for downloads and documentation. The community forums and Zulip chat are also great places to ask questions as you're learning.

Happy coding! 🐬

*This comment adds value by informing learners about an option they may not be aware of, while being helpful rather than pushy, and staying relevant to the original post's educational focus.*

**AI suggested comment:** I'd advise caution here as a MariaDB community advocate. This appears to be a promotional post for a PHP/MySQL course, so commenting could come across as:

1. **Hijacking someone's promotional content** - which may seem unprofessional
2. **Overly sales-y** if pushing MariaDB as an alternative

**If you still want to engage, here's a tactful approach:**

---

**Possible comment:**

"Great to see people learning database-driven web development! Just a friendly note for learners: MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL (created by MySQL's original developers) and is what you'll actually find on many hosting platforms and Linux distributions by default. The SQL syntax you learn will work on both, so these skills are very transferable. Good luck with your learning journey!"

---

**Why this works:**
- Educational rather than promotional
- Doesn't undermine the original post
- Adds genuine value for learners
- Mentions MariaDB's MySQL compatibility naturally
- Doesn't push people away from the course

**Alternatively:** You might skip this one entirely since it's essentially an ad, and look for posts where users have actual technical questions or are comparing database options. Those provide better opportunities for genuine community engagement.
