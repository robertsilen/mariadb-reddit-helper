No comment recommended - This is a general informational post about a Home Assistant integration. While MariaDB is mentioned briefly in the context of database configuration, the post is primarily focused on the HAGHS integration itself rather than specific MariaDB technical issues that would warrant a MariaDB Foundation response.

This is a nice contribution to the MariaDB ecosystem! Thanks for including MariaDB support in your tool. The hybrid CLI-TUI approach sounds interesting - I appreciate that you're trying a different paradigm from the typical 3-pane GUI tools.

A few questions from a MariaDB perspective: Have you tested with MariaDB-specific features like sequences, temporal tables, or our JSON functions? Also, does your tool handle MariaDB's authentication plugins correctly? The parameterized queries feature looks particularly useful for MariaDB users who work with stored procedures.

Would love to see this tool get more visibility in the MariaDB community. Consider posting about it on the MariaDB Community Slack or forums - there are always folks looking for better command-line database tools. Good luck with the project!

This looks like a really interesting tool! I love the hybrid CLI/TUI approach - it's a nice middle ground between the heavy GUI tools and pure command line work. The parameterized saved queries feature is particularly clever.

It's great to see MariaDB support included alongside the other database engines. Have you done much testing with MariaDB-specific features like storage engines, JSON functions, or some of the newer syntax extensions? I'd be curious to hear how well it handles MariaDB's unique capabilities compared to standard MySQL compatibility.

The terminal-first approach is definitely appealing for those of us who spend most of our time in SSH sessions. Looking forward to seeing how this project develops!

**AI suggested comment:** Technical Support


I can help you troubleshoot this issue. The error log shows MySQL received a shutdown signal and is force-closing connections, but something is preventing a clean shutdown/startup.

First, let's check if MySQL processes are still running: `ps aux | grep mysql` and kill any hanging processes with `sudo kill -9 <pid>`.

Then check for these common causes: socket file issues (`ls -la /var/run/mysqld/`), permission problems on data directory (`ls -la /var/lib/mysql/`), and disk space for temp files (`df -h /tmp`).

Also verify your InnoDB log files aren't corrupted by checking earlier entries in the error log before the shutdown occurred.

If you're open to it, MariaDB offers better crash recovery and monitoring tools that could help prevent similar issues. Feel free to share more details from the error log if the above steps don't resolve it.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion



This is a great discussion topic! For MariaDB specifically, there are several robust backup solutions worth considering:

For native options, mariadb-backup (based on Percona XtraBackup) provides hot backups without locking, and mysqldump remains reliable for logical backups. Many users also find success with enterprise solutions like Veeam, Commvault, or cloud-native tools if you're on AWS/GCP/Azure.

The tools you mentioned seem focused on multi-database management interfaces. For production MariaDB environments, you might want to evaluate whether a dedicated backup orchestration tool like Bacula, Amanda, or even custom scripts with proper monitoring might give you more confidence and control.

What's your primary use case - are you looking for a unified interface to manage backups across different database types, or would MariaDB-specific tooling be acceptable? Also, what's your deployment environment like (cloud, on-premises, containers)?

This question is specifically about MySQL and Doctrine ORM configuration rather than MariaDB-specific functionality. While MariaDB is MySQL-compatible and the advice would generally apply to both databases, the user is explicitly asking about MySQL setup.

Since this is a Doctrine/PHP framework question rather than a database engine question, and the user specifically mentioned MySQL rather than MariaDB, it would be more appropriate for MariaDB community members to let MySQL-focused or Doctrine-focused community members handle this one.

No comment recommended - question is MySQL/Doctrine-specific rather than MariaDB-focused.

This is a promotional post about the Oxyde ORM, which is a third-party Python ORM that supports MariaDB through MySQL compatibility. While the project includes MariaDB/MySQL support in its benchmarks and documentation, this appears to be primarily a product announcement rather than a request for help or discussion of MariaDB-specific issues.

The post would be more appropriate for a MariaDB Foundation response if the author were specifically asking about MariaDB compatibility, reporting MariaDB-specific issues, or seeking guidance on MariaDB features. Since this is mainly a general announcement of a new ORM project, it's better to let the community respond organically rather than having an official MariaDB presence in what appears to be a promotional post.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion


This appears to be a Portuguese-language discussion about transitioning from developer to DBA roles, which is more of a career advice question than a technical MariaDB issue. While the poster mentions various database systems including MySQL (which is related to MariaDB), they're primarily seeking career guidance rather than technical help with MariaDB specifically.

No comment recommended - This is a general career discussion in Portuguese about transitioning from developer to DBA roles. While databases are mentioned, it's not specifically about MariaDB technical issues and would be better addressed by database professionals in that community rather than MariaDB Foundation representation.

This seems like more of a general career and industry practices question rather than a specific MariaDB technical issue. While the post mentions MySQL in their tech stack, the core question is about internship structure and mentorship practices in startups, not database-related problems or technical implementation details.

No comment recommended - The question is primarily about career development and industry practices rather than MariaDB-specific technical issues. A MariaDB Foundation response wouldn't add meaningful value to this career-focused discussion.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Technical Support


This question appears to be about XAMPP's Apache server rather than MariaDB specifically. While XAMPP does bundle MariaDB/MySQL, the core issue is about Apache service management in Linux. As a MariaDB Foundation representative, I should focus on MariaDB-related aspects or direct them to more appropriate support channels.

No comment recommended - The question is primarily about Apache/XAMPP service management rather than MariaDB. While XAMPP includes MariaDB, the user's main concern is with Apache not being visible as a system service, which is expected behavior since XAMPP runs services in a self-contained manner rather than as system services.

This is a really interesting project! As a MariaDB advocate, I'm excited to see new tools that make database work more accessible, especially terminal-based ones. The hybrid CLI-TUI approach sounds like a great middle ground between heavy GUI tools and pure command-line work.

I notice you mention MySQL/MariaDB support - that's fantastic! Have you tested it extensively with MariaDB-specific features like sequences, temporal tables, or some of the newer JSON functions? I'd be curious to know how well it handles MariaDB's extended syntax compared to standard MySQL.

The parameterized saved queries feature looks particularly useful for common administrative tasks. This could be a great tool for MariaDB developers and DBAs who prefer staying in the terminal. I'll definitely give it a try and might share it with the MariaDB community if you don't mind. Thanks for building and open-sourcing this!

This looks like an interesting project! I appreciate that you've included MariaDB support in pam-db. The hybrid CLI/TUI approach sounds like it could be really useful for database administrators and developers who prefer working in the terminal.

A couple of questions about MariaDB-specific functionality: Does pam-db handle MariaDB's extended features like sequences, window functions, or JSON functions properly? Also, since you mentioned it's in beta, have you tested it with MariaDB's different storage engines like Aria or ColumnStore?

The parameterized queries feature looks particularly handy for common administrative tasks. If you're looking for feedback from MariaDB users specifically, you might consider sharing this in the MariaDB Community Slack or the MariaDB Zulip chat where you could get input from active MariaDB developers and users.

Thanks for building tools that support the broader MySQL/MariaDB ecosystem!

No comment recommended - This appears to be about BookStack (a PHP application) OIDC configuration rather than MariaDB/MySQL database configuration. While they mention using an external MySQL database, the issue is with the application's OIDC role assignment logic, not the database itself. This would be better addressed by BookStack community support.

This is a great contribution to the open source community! I noticed you mentioned using MySQL instead of PostgreSQL for better MyBB integration, which is a smart choice. Since you've put together this comprehensive Docker setup, you might want to consider MariaDB as an alternative to MySQL. MariaDB offers excellent MySQL compatibility while providing additional features like better performance, enhanced security, and more storage engines. It's a drop-in replacement that would work seamlessly with your MyBB setup and could offer some performance benefits for forum workloads. Your Docker template looks very thorough - thanks for sharing it with the community!

**AI suggested comment:** Performance Issue


I see you're dealing with MySQL compute costs even with no traffic. While you're currently using MySQL, you might want to consider MariaDB as an alternative - it's fully compatible with MySQL but often more resource-efficient and cost-effective. MariaDB typically has lower memory overhead and better performance optimizations that could help reduce your compute costs.

For your immediate situation, you could look into scaling down your MySQL instance size, enabling auto-scaling if available, or switching to a serverless database option. However, migrating to MariaDB could provide long-term cost benefits while maintaining full compatibility with your Laravel application. MariaDB also offers better query optimization and storage engine options that might reduce your overall resource consumption.

Would you be interested in exploring how MariaDB could help optimize both your costs and performance?

2026-01-28 12:35 UTC

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Technical Support


You're asking about an interesting architectural difference! In MariaDB/MySQL, the clustered primary key does create the "key lookup" overhead you mentioned when accessing rows via secondary indexes, since they point to the primary key value rather than the row location.

Your approach of creating a covering index with all columns in the INCLUDE clause would indeed eliminate key lookups by making the index self-contained. However, this comes with significant tradeoffs: much larger index size, increased write overhead on every DML operation, and potential maintenance complexity.

Before going down this path, consider whether the secondary index access patterns you're optimizing for are actually performance bottlenecks in your workload. Often the primary key lookups are quite fast due to caching. You might also explore more targeted covering indexes that include only the columns needed for your most critical queries, rather than all columns.

Have you measured the actual performance impact of the key lookups in your specific use case?

### [r/PostgreSQL](https://reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL) – [PostgreSQL doesn't have clustered indexes like MySQL because this type of structure makes accessing secondary indexes slow.

2026-01-28 12:35 UTC

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion


This is an interesting architectural question! You're right that PostgreSQL's heap-based storage differs from MySQL's InnoDB clustered indexes. Your proposed solution of creating an index with all columns included would indeed avoid the heap lookups that make secondary index access slower in PostgreSQL.

However, this approach has significant tradeoffs: substantial storage overhead (essentially duplicating your table), increased write costs for every DML operation, and potential maintenance complexity. You'd also need to ensure the query planner uses your covering index consistently.

Before implementing this, consider whether you're actually experiencing performance issues with secondary index lookups in your specific workload. PostgreSQL's architecture has many compensating advantages, and the performance difference may not be significant for your use case.

If you're dealing with this because you're migrating from MySQL/MariaDB and expecting similar performance characteristics, you might want to evaluate whether MariaDB would be a better fit for your specific requirements, as it maintains the clustered index benefits you're trying to replicate.

**AI suggested comment:** Performance Issue


I see you're experiencing a significant Laravel slowdown in Docker. While this appears to be primarily a PHP/containerization issue, there are a couple of database-related areas worth checking that could contribute to this performance gap.

First, verify your database connection configuration in Laravel. Even for routes with "no DB," Laravel might still be establishing database connections during bootstrap. Check if you're using the same database host configuration in both environments - bare metal might be using localhost or 127.0.0.1, while Docker might be using a different hostname that introduces DNS resolution overhead.

Second, if you do have any database queries running (even indirectly through middleware, service providers, or session storage), the network stack differences between bare metal and Docker could amplify latency. Consider using `DB::listen()` to log all queries and their execution times to see if database calls are contributing to the slowdown.

You might also want to temporarily set your database connection to 'null' in config/database.php to completely eliminate any potential database overhead and confirm the issue is purely in the PHP/Apache layer.

No comment recommended - This is clearly spam advertising fraudulent academic services including taking exams for students and bypassing proctoring systems. As a MariaDB Foundation employee, I should not engage with content that promotes academic dishonesty, and this post has no connection to MariaDB or database technologies. The post violates academic integrity policies and likely Reddit's terms of service.

I started this project right around the time I was in college and actively prototyping nearly any idea that popped in my head ("ideas guy") since I enjoyed the process more than any form of public release. I realized I had a passion for systems and network programming and decided to take a crack at something as large and ridiculous as this.

I work on this in my very limited free-time for fun and educational purposes with the goal of always learning something new, which is practically abundant on a project like this. In no way do I believe this project will become "feature complete" (i.e all races, quests, zones, etc). As of today, my *very* high-level overview of a PTR consists of:

No comment recommended - This post is about a World of Warcraft game development project that happens to mention MySQL support, but it's not seeking MariaDB-specific help or discussing database issues. The focus is on promoting a gaming project rather than addressing database technical matters that would benefit from MariaDB Foundation input.
