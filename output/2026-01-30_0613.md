No comment recommended. This is a question about content management systems and website platforms, not specifically about MariaDB. While the poster mentions they have MariaDB installed, their actual question is about choosing a CMS solution for their business website. The MariaDB component is just part of their existing infrastructure rather than the focus of their inquiry.

> Coming from years in the dark side of windows, I've always used GUI heavy tools for exploring and managing databases (namely SMSS, and more recently Datagrip).

> After switching to Linux (ubuntu > mint > arch > nixos what a journey lol), I found myself switching more and more to CLI/TUI tools.

This is a really cool project! It's always great to see developers creating tools that follow the UNIX philosophy. I love the hybrid approach you've taken with pam - using CLI commands for connection management and TUI for result exploration makes a lot of sense.

As a MariaDB advocate, I'm particularly interested in how well it works with MariaDB-specific features. Since you're supporting MySQL/MariaDB through the same adapter, you might want to consider testing with some MariaDB-specific functionality like window functions, common table expressions, or MariaDB's JSON functions to ensure full compatibility. 

The terminal-first approach is perfect for database administration tasks that MariaDB users often perform. Have you considered adding support for MariaDB-specific features like the Information Schema extensions or SHOW commands that are unique to MariaDB? Would be happy to help test it out with various MariaDB setups if you're interested in feedback from that perspective.

Great work on this project!

This is great to see Portabase continuing to evolve! The MongoDB support and redesigned storage backend sound like valuable additions. As someone who works closely with MariaDB users, I'm particularly interested in how the tool handles MariaDB-specific features.

A couple of questions for the community: Have any MariaDB users here tried Portabase yet? How does it handle MariaDB's specific storage engines and features compared to treating it as MySQL? It would be interesting to hear real-world experiences, especially with larger MariaDB deployments or those using features like Galera clustering.

The agent-based architecture sounds well-suited for distributed MariaDB setups. Looking forward to seeing how this tool develops further!

No comment recommended - this is a World of Warcraft addon project announcement. While it mentions MariaDB/MySQL as optional requirements for fixing text links, this is not a MariaDB-focused discussion and the database component is peripheral to the main project.

## MySQL: Posts

> 
> MySQL authentication was NOT successful on host 10.22..*.* , port 3337, database DB1, reason: Plugin 'mysql_native_password' is not loaded (erгог. 1524)

**AI suggested comment:** Technical Support


This appears to be a MySQL-specific authentication issue rather than a MariaDB problem. The error indicates you're using MySQL 8.4.7 with the caching_sha2_password plugin, but your scanning software (Qualis) is trying to use the older mysql_native_password authentication method which isn't available in your MySQL setup.

Since this is about MySQL rather than MariaDB, I'd recommend posting this question in MySQL-focused forums or communities where you'll get more targeted help. However, if you're interested in exploring MariaDB as an alternative, we'd be happy to help with migration questions - MariaDB handles authentication plugins differently and might better suit your scanning tool's requirements.

No comment recommended. This is a student seeking internship opportunities, not someone with MariaDB-specific questions or problems. While they mention database experience with MySQL (and MariaDB compatibility could be relevant), they're not asking for technical help or discussing MariaDB specifically. As a community advocate, engaging here would come across as recruiting rather than providing helpful technical support.

This is a great opportunity to introduce someone new to Linux to MariaDB! Since they're just starting their database journey, this would be perfect timing to suggest MariaDB as an excellent MySQL-compatible alternative that's likely already available in their Linux Mint repositories.

Here's a suggested reply:

"Welcome to Linux Mint! Great choice switching from Windows. Since you're just starting with databases, you might want to consider MariaDB instead of MySQL. MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL that's fully compatible with MySQL syntax and tools, but it's completely open source and often comes pre-installed or easily available in Linux repositories.

To answer your questions: 1) The core SQL syntax is identical across platforms, 2) You can use the same GUI tools like MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or DBeaver with both MySQL and MariaDB, 3) Both run excellently on Linux Mint.

MariaDB tends to have better performance and more features than MySQL, plus it's the default choice for many Linux distributions. You can follow Alex's tutorials exactly the same way with MariaDB since they're compatible. Just install it with 'sudo apt install mariadb-server' and you'll be good to go!"

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Technical Support


While your question is about MySQL tools, I'd like to mention that MariaDB (which is MySQL-compatible) has some excellent database management options that might address your needs.

For keyboard-friendly database editing, you might want to try:

1. MariaDB's command-line client (mysql/mariadb) - fully keyboard-driven with SQL commands
2. HeidiSQL - has better keyboard navigation than some alternatives
3. Sequel Pro (Mac) or its successor Sequel Ace - known for good keyboard shortcuts
4. phpMyAdmin - web-based with decent keyboard support

The command-line approach gives you complete keyboard control: you can write UPDATE statements, use prepared statements, and leverage SQL scripts for bulk edits. Many experienced database users find this more efficient than GUI tools once they're comfortable with SQL.

If you're open to trying MariaDB instead of MySQL, the transition is seamless for most applications, and you'll get access to additional features and performance improvements. The same tools work with both databases.

What type of editing workflow are you trying to optimize? Knowing more about your use case might help suggest the best approach.

No comment recommended - This is a general question about learning web development and design courses, not specifically about MariaDB. While the user mentions MySQL in their list of technologies, they're asking for educational resources and certificates rather than seeking technical help with database issues. This would be better addressed by general programming education communities rather than database-specific expertise.

This looks like an interesting CLI/TUI database tool! It's great to see MariaDB/MySQL support included from the start. The hybrid approach of combining CLI commands with TUI interfaces and external editors sounds like it could appeal to developers who prefer terminal-based workflows.

A few questions from a MariaDB perspective: Have you tested with MariaDB-specific features like sequences, window functions, or JSON functions? Also, does it handle MariaDB's authentication plugins correctly? Would be happy to help test MariaDB compatibility if you're looking for feedback on that front.

The tool looks well-designed and the Unix philosophy approach is refreshing. Best of luck with the project!

As a MariaDB advocate, I should not legitimize or engage with content that promotes unethical academic practices. This post has nothing to do with MariaDB or database technology and is spam in any technical community.

> I'm an undergraduate IT student who will be having a capstone research for this semester. The topic I am thinking of is creating an application that will be a smart commuter's guide.
> 
> The idea is that it will use geomapping to mark terminals for jeepneys, buses and tricycles within my city. It will also mark within the map some common spots where commuter's ride or get dropped off. This common spots can be recommended by users, which will then be verified by us. It will also show step-by-step guide on howto get to their destination like indicating what jeepneys they should ride, where they should get off, some common landmaek within the area of their destination and etc. It will also be showing some estimation on how much fare it will be and if possible ETA.
> 
> This is only a concept I am thinking of but have no idea on how I could actually implement it. My experience in system development is only basic web-based database system - mySQL with php. So far on what I have read, I can use Google Maps API for location access and tracking and AI to interpret and make sense of the data. I have no solid background on either APIs and AI so I am unsure if I can accomplish my objective in the research. 
> 
> I am willing to learn but don't have much time since it will only be around 6-7 months (capstone is completed within 2 semester) to complete the entire app. Any suggestion and help is greatly appreciated.

No comment recommended - this is a general software development question seeking academic guidance, not specifically about MariaDB. The student mentions MySQL experience but isn't asking about database-specific issues or considering database alternatives. Better suited for general programming or academic subreddits.

No comment recommended - This is clearly spam promoting academic dishonesty services. The post contains multiple red flags including offers to "take exams for you," bypass proctoring systems, complete entire degree programs for payment, and other forms of academic fraud. This content violates academic integrity policies and has nothing to do with MariaDB or legitimate database technology discussions. As a MariaDB Foundation representative, engaging with this type of content would be inappropriate and potentially harmful to the Foundation's reputation.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Technical Support


I'd be happy to help troubleshoot your database connection issue. A few quick questions to better assist you:

1. Are you trying to connect to a MariaDB or MySQL server? (Both are compatible but sometimes there are subtle differences)
2. What's the exact error message you're seeing in MySQL Workbench?
3. Is your database server running locally on your machine or on a remote host?
4. Have you verified the server is actually listening on the expected port (usually 3306) using netstat or ss commands?

Common issues are often related to firewall settings, incorrect credentials, or the server binding only to localhost. If you can share the specific error message, I can provide more targeted guidance. Also, if you're using MariaDB, you might want to try connecting with the mariadb command-line client to isolate whether it's a Workbench-specific issue.

No comment recommended - this is a World of Warcraft addon project announcement that only mentions MariaDB as an optional requirement for text data fixes. While MariaDB is mentioned, there's no specific MariaDB question or issue that would warrant a MariaDB Foundation response. The post is primarily gaming-focused rather than database-focused.
