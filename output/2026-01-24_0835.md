It's great to hear you're considering MariaDB for your SSO solution! MariaDB is an excellent choice for applications requiring robust, scalable database backend.

From your list, several options do support MariaDB as a backend database. Authentik officially supports MariaDB and many users run it successfully in production. Casdoor also has MariaDB compatibility. When evaluating these solutions, consider not just the database compatibility but also the long-term maintenance, community support, and integration ecosystem.

Since you already have MariaDB running, I'd suggest testing a few candidates with your existing setup. Authentik's popularity often comes from its comprehensive documentation, active community, and proven track record with various integrations. The MariaDB Foundation community forums are also a great resource if you run into any database-specific configuration questions during your evaluation.

I can help with the MariaDB connection part of your setup! For connecting Python to MariaDB, I recommend using the mariadb-connector-python package. You can install it with `pip install mariadb` and use it like this:

```python
import mariadb
conn = mariadb.connect(
    user="your_user",
    password="your_password", 
    host="your_synology_ip",
    port=3306,
    database="your_database"
)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO your_table VALUES (?)", (data,))
conn.commit()
```

Make sure your MariaDB user has the proper permissions and that the port 3306 is accessible from your Python environment. For the Synology-specific parts like Docker deployment and job scheduling, you might want to check the Synology community forums as those are more platform-specific issues. The MariaDB connection should work the same way regardless of whether you run it directly on Synology or in a Docker container.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion



Congratulations on your successful migration to MariaDB! It's fantastic to hear about such a dramatic performance improvement with your 400K+ image collection. Moving from SQLite to MariaDB for a large photo management system like DigiKam was definitely the right choice - MariaDB's concurrent access capabilities and query optimization really shine in scenarios like yours.

Your experience is a great example of how MariaDB can handle substantial workloads even on modest hardware like a Raspberry Pi 4. The fact that you can now import photos on one computer and see them on another within 30 seconds, plus the massive improvement in fingerprinting performance, really demonstrates MariaDB's strength in multi-user scenarios.

Thanks for sharing your success story with the community - it's encouraging for others who might be facing similar scalability challenges with their photo collections or other applications using SQLite.

> Does anyone have any experience with running VitalPBX with the MariaDB on another server?  I just want to make sure others have been able to do it before I start going crazy on this thing...

**AI suggested comment:** Technical Support


Yes, this is definitely possible and others in the community have successfully run VitalPBX with MariaDB on a separate server. The key considerations are ensuring proper network connectivity between servers, configuring MariaDB to accept remote connections (bind-address and user privileges), and updating VitalPBX's database configuration to point to the remote MariaDB instance. Make sure to secure the connection appropriately, especially if running across networks. What specific challenges are you anticipating or have you encountered during setup?

This is helpful content for SQL beginners! Just wanted to mention that all these examples work perfectly in MariaDB as well. MariaDB maintains full compatibility with MySQL syntax, so freshers can practice these exact same queries on MariaDB instances too. MariaDB also offers some additional features like window functions and common table expressions (CTEs) that can make complex queries even more readable as you advance. Good luck to anyone using these for interview prep!

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion


This is an interesting JavaFX tutorial series! I noticed you're using MySQL - have you considered trying MariaDB as an alternative? Since MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL with the same connector and syntax, your existing code would work without changes. MariaDB often provides better performance for complex permission queries like the ones in RBAC systems, plus it has some nice additional features for user management and security. The community is very active if you run into any database-specific questions. Great work on the tutorial series!

No comment recommended. This is a career advice question about a job offer that happens to mention MySQL in passing. The post is primarily about whether to accept a Product Associate role rather than seeking help with MariaDB technical issues. While the user mentions MySQL, they're not asking database-specific questions or expressing interest in alternatives like MariaDB. This appears to be better suited for career advice forums rather than database community engagement.

This sounds like a good opportunity to build strong database skills! MySQL experience with data modeling is valuable and transferable across many roles. Since you mentioned they work with an open source framework, you might want to ask if they use MariaDB as well - many companies use both or have migrated to MariaDB for its enhanced features and performance.

The Product Associate role could actually be great for your career - you'll understand both technical and business sides, which is valuable for future roles like technical product manager, solutions architect, or even senior developer positions. The MySQL/database skills you'll gain are definitely in demand.

If you're interested in staying technical long-term, you could always continue developing your coding skills on the side while gaining this valuable database and client-facing experience.

This is an interesting development for the database ecosystem. At MariaDB Foundation, we've been advocating for truly open database solutions since our fork from MySQL in 2009. MariaDB Server remains 100% open source under GPL, with all development happening transparently in the open. We've built strong backward compatibility with MySQL while adding innovative features like storage engines, advanced replication, and modern SQL capabilities. For developers concerned about Oracle's stewardship of MySQL, MariaDB offers a proven alternative with enterprise support options and a vibrant community. We'd be happy to help anyone evaluating their database options - feel free to reach out through our community channels or check out our migration guides.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Other


This is primarily a career development question rather than a MariaDB-specific technical discussion. The user is asking about portfolio project viability for job applications and mentions MySQL in their tech stack rather than MariaDB. While I could suggest MariaDB as an alternative to MySQL, this would feel like unsolicited product promotion in a context where the database choice isn't their main concern. The focus should remain on their career question, which is outside my area of expertise as a MariaDB community advocate.

No comment recommended - this is a general career advice question not related to MariaDB technical issues.

This is an interesting discussion about MySQL's future direction. As someone from the MariaDB community, I'd like to point out that MariaDB has been addressing many of these concerns since 2009. We've maintained compatibility with MySQL while adding enterprise features, improving performance, and ensuring truly open development under the MariaDB Foundation. For organizations looking for a MySQL-compatible database with a clear open-source future, MariaDB offers a proven alternative that's already being used by major companies like Wikipedia, Google, and Red Hat. We'd be happy to help anyone evaluate MariaDB as part of their database strategy.

This looks interesting! MariaDB also has its own transaction behavior that differs from both PostgreSQL and MySQL in some aspects, especially around things like deadlock handling and certain isolation level implementations. If you're building a database abstraction layer, you might want to consider MariaDB's specific transaction characteristics too - particularly around XA transactions and our enhanced crash-safe features. Would be curious to hear more about your abstraction approach and whether MariaDB support is on your roadmap.

While an analyzer tool sounds interesting, I'd like to point out that MariaDB has excellent JSON support starting from version 10.2, with JSON functions that are compatible with MySQL 5.7+ and additional enhancements. MariaDB also supports both JSON and LONGTEXT storage for JSON data, giving developers flexibility. Your analyzer idea could definitely include MariaDB in its compatibility checks - we'd be happy to help with technical details about MariaDB's JSON capabilities and version-specific features if that would be useful for your project.

> Hi, I have a question for those who used Lovable as a builder but moved the project outside of the platform.
> 
> I built a web application in Lovable, primarily the frontend and UI logic. The backend and database are not in Lovable – I use my own API and a MySQL database hosted on my site. I treat Lovable as a tool for rapid prototyping, but I don't want it to be my target environment.
> 
> Important goals: – Hosting on my own server with cPanel for management
> – Static build (HTML/CSS/JS) if possible
> – No runtime dependencies on Lovable
> – Normal SEO (meta, indexing, sitemap)
> – Launching the application as a subpage of an existing website, not a separate domain
> Questions for you:
> 
> What is the most sensible way to "extract" the application from Lovable and deploy it statically on hosting with cPanel?  Has anyone exported a project from Lovable and deployed it as a static build (e.g., Next export / Vite)?
> What should I watch out for when dealing with elements that were running dynamically or "in the background" in Lovable?
> In your experience, what is better to rewrite manually instead of trying a 1:1 migration?
> I'm not looking for an official path, just real-world experiences from people who have moved from Lovable to self-hosting. Thanks for any suggestions.

No comment recommended - This question is about migrating from a web application builder called "Lovable" to self-hosting, which is not related to MariaDB. While the user mentions using MySQL as their database, the core questions are about frontend deployment and static site generation rather than database-related issues that would benefit from MariaDB Foundation input.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Spam


No comment recommended - This is academic fraud/cheating service spam that is completely unrelated to MariaDB. While it mentions MySQL and other databases in its extensive service list, it's clearly promoting academic dishonesty and has no legitimate technical discussion. A MariaDB Foundation employee should not engage with or validate this type of content in any way.
