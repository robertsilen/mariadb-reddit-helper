> This is one of my first post reaching out about something I have been banging my head against a wall with no cracks in the wall yet. I am new to reverse proxies and not able to get the console in Proxmox to say open. I have Nginx Proxy Manager 2.13.6 on a VM running in docker. I set it up in Portainer with stacks and have it running with mariadb. I am able to start a console but after 15 seconds or so it just freezes up and no longer able to do anything with the console Proxmox 9.1.4. Everything else works fine.
> 
> I have read and read about configurations to custom about setting parameters under location like "proxy\_read\_timeouts" and "upgrade" and tried. NOTHING has worked. Not sure if I am adding it correctly. When turning on Websocket support in NPM,  I try to go look at the back end configuration via docker exec and it sets it to "$http\_connection" not upgrade. I can't get it to work. Please need some help. The code block is a copy from the .conf file that NPM creates under /data/nginx/proxy\_host/ for that host.

No comment recommended - This is a Proxmox/Nginx reverse proxy configuration issue that doesn't relate to MariaDB technical problems. While the user mentions MariaDB is part of their NPM setup, the actual issue is with websocket timeouts and proxy configuration for Proxmox console access, not database functionality.

> What are the current thoughts around using MariaDB/MySQL over the built-in XML file to store the comic metadata?  I’ve had a couple of CRCE lock-ups (usually using Library Organizer) that force me to kill CRCE and restart it.  This usually results in me re-processing the couple hundred comics that worked on over the previous couple of hours.  I’ve used a MariaDB backend in the past, and while it has generally slowed down the usage of CRCE, anytime I’ve had to kill CRCE and restart it, there have been either no, or very few records to reprocess.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion


Thank you for sharing your experience with MariaDB! It sounds like you're using ComicRack Community Edition (CRCE) and considering database backends for better data persistence.

Your observation about MariaDB providing better crash recovery compared to XML files aligns with what we'd expect - databases are designed for ACID compliance and durability. The slower performance you mentioned could potentially be optimized through proper indexing, connection pooling, or tuning MariaDB's configuration for your specific workload.

If you decide to move forward with MariaDB, I'd be happy to help with performance optimization questions. The MariaDB community also has great resources for tuning configurations based on your hardware and usage patterns. Have you considered testing with MariaDB's latest versions? There have been significant performance improvements in recent releases.

**AI suggested comment:** Technical Support


This is a comprehensive tutorial in Portuguese for installing and configuring Koha library management system. As a MariaDB advocate, I appreciate seeing MariaDB being used as part of the LAMP stack for Koha installations.

The tutorial covers all the essential components including MariaDB database setup, and I notice the author correctly identifies MariaDB as one of the core components of Koha's LAMP stack. The database configuration steps look solid - installing MariaDB server, setting root password, and configuring the Koha database instance.

One suggestion for the MariaDB configuration: consider adding performance tuning recommendations for library workloads, such as adjusting innodb_buffer_pool_size based on available RAM, since Koha can be database-intensive with large catalogs. Also, the backup strategy using mysqldump is good, but for larger libraries, you might want to mention mariadb-backup for hot backups.

The automated backup script using rclone to Google Drive is particularly useful for smaller libraries. Overall, this is excellent work helping librarians deploy open source solutions with MariaDB at the foundation.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Job Posting


No comment recommended. This is a German-language resume review request where someone mentions MariaDB only briefly as part of their tech stack. While they're seeking feedback on their CV for full-stack development roles that include MariaDB experience, this is primarily a career advice post rather than a technical MariaDB discussion. A MariaDB Foundation response wouldn't add significant value to what is essentially a personal career consultation in a non-English forum.

This is an excellent perspective on MariaDB's pluggable architecture! One of MariaDB's greatest strengths is indeed this flexibility - being able to choose the right storage engine for each use case rather than forcing everything into a single model.

We've seen some fascinating production deployments where teams use InnoDB for transactional workloads, ColumnStore for analytics, and Spider for sharding - all within the same MariaDB instance. The plugin ecosystem extends far beyond storage engines too, with authentication plugins, audit plugins, and specialized functions.

Thanks for sharing this deep dive! The architectural flexibility you're highlighting is something we're really proud of at MariaDB Foundation. Would love to hear about any specific plugin combinations or custom extensions others in the community are working with. The plugin interfaces are designed to be developer-friendly, so we always enjoy seeing creative implementations in the wild.

No comment recommended. This post is primarily about Linux gaming performance and general Linux desktop experience. While the author briefly mentions MariaDB in passing when comparing database installations between Windows and Linux, it's not seeking help with MariaDB specifically - they're just noting that Arch-based distributions tend to favor MariaDB over MySQL. The mention is too peripheral to warrant a technical response about MariaDB.

No comment recommended - This post is about a World of Warcraft fan game project and only mentions MySQL in passing as a supported database technology. While the project uses MySQL currently, there's no specific MariaDB question, issue, or discussion that would warrant a response from a MariaDB advocate. The mention of database support is too brief and tangential to the main topic to justify engagement.

While this post mentions MySQL/databases briefly, it's primarily seeking career advice for transitioning from biomedical technology to cybersecurity/IT rather than asking for technical help with MariaDB. The database mention is just context about current duties.

No comment recommended - this is a career guidance question outside MariaDB Foundation's scope, and the brief database reference doesn't warrant technical input about MariaDB/MySQL.

For a personal comics/art website, you have options! If it's just a few static pages with images, simple HTML files might work initially. But if you plan to have multiple comics, user comments, tags, or want to easily add new content, a database will make your life much easier.

Since you're already learning MySQL, MariaDB would be a great choice - it's fully compatible with MySQL but with better performance and more features. It's open source and has excellent community support. For a personal site, MariaDB paired with PHP would give you a solid foundation to grow your comic site with features like automatic galleries, search functionality, and easy content management.

The learning curve is worth it if you want your site to be dynamic and expandable!

> Should I learn Postgres or MySQL for strong foundations. Any advantages learning MySQL and then starting with Postgres? Please advice. Thanks 

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion


As a MariaDB advocate, I'd suggest considering MariaDB as well! MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL with better performance, more storage engines, and enhanced security features. It maintains MySQL compatibility while adding modern innovations.

If you're choosing between the two you mentioned, both PostgreSQL and MySQL have their strengths. MySQL (and MariaDB) might be easier to start with due to simpler setup and more straightforward syntax, while PostgreSQL offers more advanced features out of the box.

For learning foundations, starting with MariaDB/MySQL concepts will teach you relational database fundamentals, and those skills transfer well to any database system. The SQL standards are largely portable between systems.

What type of projects are you planning to work on? That might help determine the best starting point for your specific needs.

While you mentioned MySQL, it sounds like you're asking for general career advice rather than specific MariaDB technical help. Since you're already working with MySQL databases for medical imaging, you might want to explore MariaDB as an alternative - it offers excellent performance for healthcare applications and has strong compliance features that are valuable in medical environments. The skills transfer directly between MySQL and MariaDB, so learning MariaDB could broaden your database expertise. For your career path, the Clinical support role sounds like it would give you valuable hands-on database administration experience that employers look for in healthcare IT positions.

This sounds like a great career path combining your biomedical background with IT! Your MySQL database experience is valuable, and since you're already working with healthcare data, you might want to consider expanding your database skills to include MariaDB as well. Many healthcare organizations are adopting MariaDB for its reliability, security features, and cost-effectiveness compared to proprietary database solutions.

The Clinical support role you mentioned would definitely strengthen your resume - hands-on experience with healthcare IT systems is highly valued. For healthcare IT positions, focus on database administration, data security and compliance (HIPAA), and understanding how clinical systems integrate. Your unique combination of biomedical hardware knowledge and database skills makes you an ideal candidate for roles like Clinical Systems Analyst or Healthcare Database Administrator, where you'd understand both the technical and clinical sides of medical equipment data management.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion



This is an interesting concept that could definitely benefit database workloads! From a MariaDB perspective, your focus on ECC memory, predictable latency, and server-grade components aligns well with what we recommend for production database servers.

Many small businesses and development teams do struggle with the noise/space constraints of traditional server hardware while still needing the reliability of enterprise components for their databases. A quiet, office-friendly solution with proper ECC memory and IPMI would be valuable for MariaDB deployments in smaller environments.

For MariaDB specifically, consider optimizing storage layout for database workloads - fast NVMe for transaction logs, separate storage pools for data, and ensure your motherboard selection supports sufficient PCIe lanes for storage expansion. The ability to run enterprise-grade MariaDB instances without a dedicated server room could definitely fill a gap in the market.

If you move forward with this, I'd be interested to hear how MariaDB performs on your builds compared to traditional rackmount solutions.

As a MariaDB Foundation advocate, I'd encourage developers to consider MariaDB as a proven alternative that has already addressed many of these concerns. MariaDB was created specifically to ensure the continued open source development of the MySQL codebase, maintaining compatibility while adding innovative features and maintaining transparent governance. We've built a strong community-driven development model and have enterprise support options available. The MariaDB Foundation ensures that the project remains truly open source and community-focused. Happy to discuss specific migration considerations or technical questions if you're evaluating options.

Great work on your Stalwart mail cluster setup! While you've chosen FoundationDB for this deployment, I'm curious - did you consider MariaDB as an alternative for the database layer? MariaDB offers excellent clustering capabilities with Galera Cluster that could provide similar high availability benefits for mail server deployments. MariaDB Galera Cluster supports multi-master replication with automatic failover and would integrate well with traditional mail stacks. If you ever want to explore different database options for mail infrastructure or have questions about MariaDB's clustering capabilities, the community would be happy to help. Your cost-effective HA approach is impressive regardless of the stack chosen!

This is clearly spam/advertising for academic dishonesty services (cheating on exams, having someone else take tests, etc.). This post has absolutely nothing to do with MariaDB or database technology. It's promoting unethical academic services that violate academic integrity policies. 

No comment recommended - this content is completely unrelated to MariaDB and promotes academic misconduct, which should not be engaged with or legitimized through any response from a MariaDB representative.

**AI suggested comment:** Technical Support


I can see you're getting a JVM warning related to class sharing. This warning typically occurs when using certain JVM flags or bytecode manipulation libraries (like ByteBuddy in your Mockito tests) that modify the bootstrap classpath.

To resolve this warning, try removing the ByteBuddy javaagent configuration from your maven-surefire-plugin. Your current argLine configuration is likely unnecessary for basic Mockito testing. Simply remove or comment out the javaagent line in your pom.xml:

```
<argLine>
   -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions
   -XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading
</argLine>
```

Also, I notice you're using MySQL connector in your dependencies. If you're open to trying MariaDB, you could replace it with the MariaDB Java connector which offers excellent compatibility and performance. Just replace the mysql-connector-j dependency with org.mariadb.jdbc:mariadb-java-client. The warning itself isn't MariaDB-specific, but MariaDB could be a great alternative database option for your Spring Boot application!

No comment recommended - While the user mentions moving from MySQL to PostgreSQL, this is presented as a personal project challenge rather than a request for technical help or discussion about MariaDB specifically. The post is primarily an introduction to their personal development blog rather than seeking database-related assistance. MariaDB isn't mentioned, and engaging here would appear off-topic and promotional rather than helpful.

No comment recommended - This is promotional content for third-party courses with suspicious links ("easylearn.ing" domain). While it mentions MySQL/MariaDB peripherally in course descriptions, it's primarily spam advertising unrelated training materials rather than seeking technical assistance or community discussion about MariaDB specifically.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Spam


No comment recommended - This is a spam post promoting Udemy course coupons through affiliate links. It has no relation to MariaDB or database technology, and engaging with promotional spam content would not be appropriate for a MariaDB Foundation representative. The post is purely commercial in nature and doesn't contain any technical discussion that would benefit from MariaDB community input.

### [r/udemyfreebies](https://reddit.com/r/udemyfreebies) – [Learn PHP Programming: Create Dynamic Websites with MYSQL](https://reddit.com/r/udemyfreebies/comments/1qmhd27/learn_php_programming_create_dynamic_websites/)

No comment recommended - This appears to be educational content about PHP and MySQL rather than MariaDB-specific. While MariaDB is MySQL-compatible, the post doesn't indicate any MariaDB usage or specific questions that would warrant Foundation involvement. Better to let the community handle general PHP/MySQL educational discussions unless MariaDB is specifically mentioned or there's a clear opportunity to highlight MariaDB's advantages.

This is an interesting discussion about MySQL's future under Oracle. As someone from MariaDB Foundation, I'd be happy to share our perspective on this topic. MariaDB was created specifically to address concerns about MySQL's direction under Oracle ownership, maintaining true open source principles while ensuring community-driven development. We've focused on remaining compatible with MySQL while adding innovative features and maintaining transparent governance. If you're evaluating alternatives to Oracle's MySQL, MariaDB offers a drop-in replacement with strong community support, regular releases, and a commitment to staying open source. Happy to discuss specific technical or licensing questions if you have any.
