> So, I’ve been working on this thing called [**DailyPitch**](https://dailypitch.app). I’ll be honest—the last few weeks have been a bit of a blur. If you’ve ever tried to launch something online, you know the feeling. You spend weeks or months staring at a screen, perfecting every pixel, and then you finally put it out there. And then? Usually nothing. Or maybe a few likes from your friends.

I spent way too many nights debugging why the daily reset wasn't firing at midnight UTC. My "minimalist" UI turned into a mess of spaghetti code before I finally stripped it back to what mattered. I’m using Next.js and mariaDB because I wanted to move fast, but even then, the logic for gamifying the growth metrics was a headache.

No comment recommended. This appears to be promotional content for a product called DailyPitch rather than a genuine MariaDB-related question or discussion. While the author mentions using MariaDB as part of their tech stack, they're not seeking technical help, reporting issues, or asking MariaDB-specific questions. The post is primarily focused on promoting their platform and gathering feedback about their business concept rather than database technology.

Thank you for sharing this important analysis on OLTP benchmarking methodology! This is exactly the kind of technical discussion the MariaDB community needs. The points about hardware relevance and the limitations of sysbench-tpcc versus real-world OLTP workloads are crucial for anyone making database technology decisions. As someone from the MariaDB Foundation, I really appreciate seeing rigorous examination of benchmarking practices that affect how our database gets evaluated. Have you considered extending this analysis to cover other common benchmarking pitfalls we see in the field?

I appreciate you sharing this detailed walkthrough! It's great to see MariaDB being used with modern deployment stacks like Dokploy and Laravel-based CMSs. A couple of quick notes that might help others following your setup:

For the MariaDB configuration, you might want to consider adding some basic performance tuning parameters to your compose file, especially innodb_buffer_pool_size if you're planning to handle significant content. Also, MariaDB 10.11 LTS might be worth considering over 10.6 for new deployments as it offers better performance and longer support.

The permission issues you encountered are pretty common in containerized environments - your solution with matching UIDs is spot on. Thanks for documenting the HTTPS proxy challenges too, as that's something many people struggle with when moving from development to production environments.

This is a helpful post about deploying Microweber with MariaDB. Since you're sharing a complete working setup that others might find valuable, this looks solid overall. One small suggestion - you might want to consider using MariaDB 11.x instead of 10.6, as it offers better performance and newer features that could benefit a Laravel-based CMS like Microweber. The 10.6 series is still supported but 11.x is now the current stable branch. Great job documenting all the gotchas you encountered - this kind of real-world troubleshooting guide is really valuable for the community.

For the MariaDB parts, you might want to check if Uptime Kuma uses foreign key constraints or triggers that could be preventing direct database inserts for monitored items. Try examining the database schema with "SHOW CREATE TABLE" for the monitoring tables to understand the relationships. Also, check MariaDB's error log and general log (if enabled) to see if there are any constraint violations when you attempt to insert monitoring items directly. You might have better luck using Uptime Kuma's API endpoints instead of direct database manipulation, as the application likely has validation logic that direct SQL bypasses. If you continue with the database approach, make sure you're populating all required fields and maintaining proper foreign key relationships between users, groups, and monitored items.

No comment recommended - While this post mentions MariaDB in the docker-compose setup, it's primarily focused on deploying Microweber CMS on Dokploy rather than addressing any specific MariaDB technical issues. The database configuration appears to be working correctly in their setup, and the post is more of a deployment guide than a request for MariaDB-specific help.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Technical Support


I'd recommend running nginx as a container in your docker-compose.yaml for better consistency and maintainability. This keeps your infrastructure as code and makes deployments more predictable.

For your MariaDB setup with 1000 users, make sure you've tuned key parameters like max_connections, innodb_buffer_pool_size, and query_cache_size appropriately. Since you're running MariaDB on the host, ensure proper backup strategies are in place and consider using connection pooling if you expect high concurrent usage during peak times.

Your architecture sounds solid overall - the bind mount for attachments is a good approach for persistent data with Redmine.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion


This post is asking about general career advice for Java backend development rather than seeking help with MariaDB-specific technical issues. While the developer mentions using MySQL, they're not asking about database problems or considering MariaDB migration.

No comment recommended - This is primarily a career guidance question focused on Java/Spring Boot skills rather than database-related concerns. The mention of MySQL is incidental, and there's no indication the person is experiencing database issues or looking for database alternatives.

**AI suggested comment:** Performance Issue


This looks like a Laravel/Docker performance issue rather than a MariaDB-specific problem. Since you mention testing with "simple route, no DB" and getting 450-550ms response times, the bottleneck appears to be in the application layer rather than database connectivity.

However, if you do have database queries in your actual application, I'd recommend checking a few MariaDB-related aspects: verify your Docker container can efficiently connect to your MariaDB instance (check if you're using localhost vs container networking), monitor connection pooling behavior, and ensure your MariaDB configuration is optimized for your connection pattern. You might also want to enable the slow query log to see if any database operations are contributing to the performance gap when you do test with database interactions.

For the broader Docker performance issue, you might want to look into PHP-FPM configuration, file I/O patterns, and container resource constraints, but those are outside MariaDB's scope.

No comment recommended - This is a personal game development project announcement that happens to mention MySQL support among many other technical details. While they mention MySQL, there's no MariaDB-specific question, issue, or discussion point that would warrant a MariaDB Foundation response.

While the question is about MySQL, as a MariaDB advocate I'd like to mention that MariaDB offers excellent JSON functionality that might help with your multi-tenant SaaS architecture. For your product modeling challenge across different business types (giros), I'd suggest considering a hybrid approach: keep common product attributes in your main table and use MariaDB's robust JSON columns for giro-specific attributes. This avoids the maintenance complexity of multiple tables while being more performant than full EAV patterns. MariaDB's JSON functions make querying and indexing JSON data quite efficient. The separate tables per giro approach you mentioned would indeed become difficult to maintain at scale. Have you considered MariaDB as an alternative? It maintains MySQL compatibility while offering enhanced JSON capabilities and better performance for your transactional SaaS requirements.

Hi there! This sounds like an interesting project. As someone from the MariaDB Foundation, I'd love to point out that many users work with MariaDB databases as well, which shares MySQL compatibility but also has its own unique features and syntax extensions. 

If you're looking to make your tool broadly useful, considering MariaDB compatibility would be valuable - there's significant overlap in the user base. Features like supporting MariaDB-specific column types, storage engines, and syntax could help differentiate your tool. I'd be happy to provide feedback from a MariaDB perspective if you'd like to share the link. Good luck with the project!

This appears to be about packaging a Java application with MySQL Connector/J dependencies rather than a MariaDB-specific issue. While MariaDB is MySQL-compatible and can work with MySQL Connector/J, this is primarily a Java build/packaging question. The user would benefit more from Java-focused communities, though I could mention MariaDB's native Java connector as an alternative.

This looks like a helpful technical post about getting Microweber CMS running with MariaDB on Docker. The user has done good work documenting their setup process and sharing their working Docker Compose configuration. While they've already solved their issue, this is a great opportunity to acknowledge their contribution to the community and offer MariaDB-specific guidance.

Great work documenting your Microweber setup with MariaDB! Your Docker Compose configuration looks solid. A couple of MariaDB-specific suggestions: consider upgrading to MariaDB 11.x for better Laravel compatibility, and you might want to add some MariaDB tuning variables like innodb_buffer_pool_size for better performance with CMS workloads. Also, setting explicit character sets (utf8mb4) in your MariaDB config can prevent encoding issues down the road. Thanks for sharing this detailed walkthrough - it'll definitely help others deploying similar Laravel-based applications with MariaDB!

This is a helpful community post about setting up Microweber with MariaDB on Docker/Dokploy. Great to see MariaDB 10.6 working well in your stack! Your Docker Compose configuration looks solid. One small suggestion - you might want to consider MariaDB 10.11 or 11.4 for better long-term support, as 10.6 will reach end of life in July 2026. Also, for production deployments, you could add some MariaDB-specific optimizations like setting innodb_buffer_pool_size based on your VPS memory. Thanks for sharing this detailed walkthrough - it'll definitely help others deploying similar Laravel/CMS stacks with MariaDB!

This is a helpful technical guide showing a working MariaDB setup with Microweber CMS. Since this appears to be a successful deployment sharing solution details rather than requesting help, and the MariaDB configuration looks standard, a brief acknowledgment would be appropriate but not essential.

Suggested reply:

Thanks for sharing this detailed setup guide! It's great to see MariaDB 10.6 working well with Microweber in your Docker deployment. Your database configuration looks solid, and this kind of real-world deployment documentation is valuable for the community. The permissions and proxy issues you encountered are common Docker challenges, and your solutions should help others facing similar setups. If you run into any MariaDB-specific performance tuning needs as your CMS grows, feel free to reach out to the community.

No comment recommended - This is a general job posting for a junior developer position that mentions MySQL as one of many skills. As a MariaDB advocate, engaging here would be off-topic since the post isn't seeking MariaDB-specific advice or opportunities, and the focus is on general career guidance rather than database-related technical discussion.

No comment recommended - This appears to be promotional content advertising a task scheduler tool rather than seeking help or discussing MariaDB-specific topics. While the tool mentions MySQL support, this is primarily a product announcement rather than a genuine technical discussion or question about MariaDB.

No comment recommended - This is promotional content with affiliate links disguised as an informational post. The post is primarily focused on web hosting services rather than MariaDB-specific topics. While some hosting providers may offer MariaDB/MySQL databases, this content is clearly commercial in nature and not suitable for technical engagement from a MariaDB Foundation perspective.

This is a career advice question rather than a MariaDB technical discussion. While the student mentions working with MySQL, they're asking for general backend specialization guidance, not specific database help. As a MariaDB Foundation representative, this isn't the most appropriate place for me to provide career counseling, and my response might seem like we're trying to steer the conversation toward our products inappropriately.

No comment recommended - this is a general career advice question not specifically about MariaDB or database technology.

This looks like a great resource for SQL learning! It's fantastic that you've created interactive exercises based on real-world use cases. The topics you cover - CTEs, window functions, complex JOINs - are essential skills for database work.

I'd love to see MariaDB support added to your platform alongside MySQL and PostgreSQL. MariaDB offers some unique features and syntax extensions that would be valuable for learners to explore, especially given its growing adoption in enterprise environments. The interactive sandbox approach would be perfect for demonstrating MariaDB-specific functionality like sequences, temporal tables, or the newer SQL standard features we support.

Would you be interested in discussing adding MariaDB as a third database option? I'd be happy to help with any technical aspects of integration.

No comment recommended - this is a generic promotional post listing free Udemy courses across various topics. While some database courses are mentioned, this isn't seeking MariaDB-specific help or discussion, and commenting would appear promotional rather than helpful to the community.

2026-01-27 13:35 UTC

> Made a collection of SQL questions that let you practice on actual databases instead of just reading solutions.
> 
> Covers the usual suspects:
> 
> * Complex JOINs and self-joins
> * Window functions (RANK, ROW\_NUMBER, etc.)
> * Subqueries vs CTEs
> * Aggregation edge cases
> * Date/time manipulation
> 
> Each question runs on real MySQL or PostgreSQL instances in your browser. No Docker, no local setup - just write queries and see results immediately.

This looks like a valuable learning resource! It's great to see interactive SQL practice environments. While your collection focuses on MySQL and PostgreSQL, I'd love to see MariaDB included as an option since it offers unique features like window functions enhancements, common table expressions improvements, and various storage engines that could provide interesting learning scenarios. MariaDB's compatibility with MySQL syntax would make it relatively straightforward to adapt existing exercises. Have you considered adding MariaDB as a third database option for learners to explore?

No comment recommended - This appears to be a general educational request about MySQL practice assessments rather than a specific MariaDB technical issue or discussion that would benefit from MariaDB Foundation input. The post lacks specific technical details and seems focused on general MySQL/PHP learning resources.

No comment recommended - This is a spam post advertising Udemy courses and promotional links that has nothing to do with MariaDB or database technology. It appears to be posted to drive traffic to coupon/affiliate sites and should not be engaged with.

No comment recommended. This is clearly spam content promoting coupon/discount links for various Udemy courses and has no relation to MariaDB or database technologies. While some courses mention MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, this appears to be automated promotional content rather than a genuine request for database help or discussion.

No comment recommended - this appears to be promotional content for a paid course rather than a genuine technical discussion or question about MariaDB. The post doesn't contain any specific technical content or questions that would warrant a technical response from a MariaDB community advocate.

No comment recommended. This appears to be a generic MySQL tutorial or promotional post that doesn't contain any specific technical questions, problems, or discussion points that would benefit from MariaDB Foundation input. Since it focuses on MySQL rather than MariaDB and seems more like educational content or self-promotion rather than a genuine request for help or discussion, it wouldn't be appropriate for a MariaDB advocate to comment unless there were specific technical questions raised in the post content.
