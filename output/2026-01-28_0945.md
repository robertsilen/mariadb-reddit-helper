> So, I’ve been working on this thing called [**DailyPitch**](https://dailypitch.app). I’ll be honest—the last few weeks have been a bit of a blur. If you’ve ever tried to launch something online, you know the feeling. You spend weeks or months staring at a screen, perfecting every pixel, and then you finally put it out there. And then? Usually nothing. Or maybe a few likes from your friends.

> I thought it’d be easy. I’d just whip up a leaderboard, add some "pitch" buttons, and call it a day. I was wrong. I spent way too many nights debugging why the daily reset wasn't firing at midnight UTC. My "minimalist" UI turned into a mess of spaghetti code before I finally stripped it back to what mattered. I’m using Next.js and mariaDB because I wanted to move fast, but even then, the logic for gamifying the growth metrics was a headache.

No comment recommended - This appears to be promotional content for a product called DailyPitch rather than a MariaDB-specific question or discussion. While the author mentions using MariaDB in their tech stack, they aren't seeking help, reporting issues, or discussing MariaDB-related topics. The focus is on promoting their platform and general startup discussion rather than database-specific content that would warrant a MariaDB Foundation response.

This is excellent work highlighting important considerations for fair database benchmarking! As someone from MariaDB Foundation, I really appreciate you sharing this analysis of why proper methodology matters so much in OLTP comparisons.

The points about hardware relevance and the limitations of sysbench-tpcc versus real-world workloads are particularly valuable for the community. Fair benchmarking benefits everyone by helping users make informed decisions based on realistic performance expectations.

Thank you for taking the time to put together such a thorough examination of these methodology issues. This kind of technical analysis helps raise the bar for meaningful database performance discussions across the industry.

Thanks for sharing this detailed setup guide! It's great to see MariaDB being used in modern containerized deployments like this. Your choice of MariaDB 10.6 is solid - it provides excellent compatibility with Laravel applications like Microweber while offering good performance and stability.

A couple of suggestions that might help others following your setup: Consider upgrading to MariaDB 10.11 or 11.4 (our current LTS versions) for even better performance and security features. Also, you might want to add some basic MariaDB tuning variables to your compose file's environment section, like setting innodb_buffer_pool_size based on your VPS memory allocation.

Your troubleshooting process around permissions and SSL issues will definitely help others deploying similar Laravel-based CMSs with MariaDB backends. Thanks for taking the time to document this!

Thanks for sharing your detailed Microweber setup experience! This is a great walkthrough for the community. I noticed you're using MariaDB 10.6 in your setup, which is a solid choice for Laravel-based applications like Microweber.

A couple of MariaDB-specific suggestions that might help others following your guide: Consider upgrading to MariaDB 10.11 (current LTS) or 11.4 (latest stable) for better performance and security. Also, you might want to add some MariaDB tuning environment variables to your compose file, like MARIADB_INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_SIZE and MARIADB_MAX_CONNECTIONS, depending on your VPS resources.

Your permissions and PHP version troubleshooting will definitely save others some headaches. The mixed content SSL fix is particularly valuable since proxy setups can be tricky with Laravel's URL generation.

No comment recommended. While this post mentions MariaDB, the primary issue is about automating Uptime Kuma configuration rather than a MariaDB-specific problem. The user is just using MariaDB as the backend database and their main challenges are with the application automation, REST APIs, and monitoring setup. This would be better addressed by the Uptime Kuma community or system automation experts.

No comment recommended - while the post mentions using MariaDB in the Docker Compose setup, it's primarily a deployment guide for a specific CMS platform rather than a MariaDB-focused issue.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Technical Support


I'd recommend running NGINX as a container in your docker compose setup for better consistency and management. This keeps your infrastructure as code and makes it easier to maintain, scale, and replicate across environments.

For your MariaDB configuration with 1000 users, make sure you have appropriate connection pooling configured and consider tuning key parameters like max_connections, innodb_buffer_pool_size, and query_cache_size based on your server resources. You might also want to consider containerizing MariaDB eventually for easier backup/restore operations and environment consistency, though your current host-based setup will work fine.

Feel free to share your MariaDB configuration if you'd like specific tuning recommendations for your Redmine workload!

No comment recommended - This question is primarily about configuring SOGo webmail with Stalwart mail server, which falls outside MariaDB's domain. While MariaDB is mentioned as a potential data store option, the core issue is about SOGo authentication mechanisms and integration patterns rather than database-specific functionality.

This looks like a really useful project! I'd encourage you to consider MariaDB compatibility as you develop your MySQL schema visualization tool. MariaDB maintains strong compatibility with MySQL but also includes some unique features like:

- Storage engines (Aria, ColumnStore, Spider)
- JSON functions and syntax extensions  
- Virtual/computed columns with different syntax
- Sequence objects
- Some MariaDB-specific data types

Many organizations use MariaDB instead of or alongside MySQL, so supporting both would significantly expand your tool's usefulness. The MariaDB Foundation documentation has details on syntax differences that might be helpful for your development. Would love to see how this tool evolves!

No comment recommended - This is specifically about MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench, not MariaDB. The user is trying to set up MySQL components for a class and experiencing compatibility issues with macOS versions. Since this is purely a MySQL question and doesn't involve MariaDB products, it would not be appropriate for a MariaDB Foundation employee to comment unless suggesting MariaDB as an alternative solution, which may not be helpful if they need MySQL specifically for their coursework.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Technical Support


This sounds like a Java application packaging issue rather than a MariaDB-specific problem. Since you're using MySQL Connector/J, you might want to consider switching to MariaDB Connector/J which is fully compatible and often performs better. For packaging, you'll need to create a "fat JAR" or "uber JAR" that includes all dependencies. You can use Maven with the maven-assembly-plugin or maven-shade-plugin, or Gradle with the shadow plugin to bundle the JDBC driver with your application. The connector JAR needs to be included in your final package, not just referenced as an external library.

Thanks for sharing this detailed Microweber setup guide! It's great to see MariaDB being used in modern deployment scenarios. Your Docker Compose configuration looks solid - MariaDB 10.6 is a good stable choice for Laravel-based applications like Microweber.

One small suggestion: you might want to consider upgrading to MariaDB 10.11 or 11.4 (our current LTS versions) for better performance and security features, especially since you're already using PHP 8.2. The migration should be seamless for most Laravel applications.

Also, for production deployments, you might want to add some MariaDB-specific optimizations to your compose file like setting innodb_buffer_pool_size based on your VPS memory allocation. This can significantly improve performance with content-heavy CMSs.

Great work troubleshooting all those deployment issues - this kind of real-world documentation is incredibly valuable for the community!

This is an excellent question about backend specialization! Regarding databases, since you mentioned working with MySQL, I'd encourage you to explore MariaDB as well. MariaDB is MySQL-compatible but offers additional features, better performance in many cases, and has strong open-source governance through the MariaDB Foundation.

For your career path, I'd suggest diving deeper into those database concepts you mentioned - query optimization, indexing, and database design are crucial backend skills that many developers overlook. MariaDB has excellent documentation and community resources to help you learn these concepts. You might also want to explore MariaDB's newer features like temporal tables, JSON support, and columnar storage with ColumnStore.

Your hands-on projects like socket servers show good systems thinking. Consider building a project that showcases database performance optimization or implements database-driven microservices - these demonstrate the "depth" that complements framework knowledge and makes backend developers truly valuable.

This looks like a great resource for SQL learning! I appreciate that you've created hands-on exercises based on real-world scenarios. The interactive sandbox approach is definitely valuable for learning SQL concepts.

I noticed you mention MySQL and PostgreSQL support - have you considered adding MariaDB to your platform? MariaDB offers some unique features and optimizations that many developers work with, and it would be a great addition to your collection. Many of the advanced SQL features you're covering (CTEs, window functions, complex JOINs) work excellently in MariaDB, and there are some MariaDB-specific optimizations and syntax extensions that could make for interesting exercises.

If you're interested in exploring MariaDB integration, the MariaDB Foundation would be happy to help with resources and technical guidance. Thanks for contributing to the SQL education community!

No comment recommended - this is clearly spam promoting academic cheating services. It includes explicit offers to bypass proctoring software, take exams for students, and has nothing to do with MariaDB or database technology. This type of content violates educational integrity policies and should not receive engagement from a legitimate technical organization representative.

No comment recommended - This is a general promotional post about cloud database services (written in Portuguese) that mentions various providers including PlanetScale (MySQL), Supabase and Neon (PostgreSQL), and MongoDB Atlas, but doesn't mention MariaDB at all. While it could be an opportunity to suggest MariaDB SkySQL as an alternative, the post appears more promotional than seeking genuine advice, and engaging might come across as overly promotional rather than helpful.

This looks like a great resource for SQL practice! It's wonderful to see interactive learning tools that help people develop their database skills hands-on.

I noticed you mentioned MySQL and PostgreSQL support - any plans to add MariaDB compatibility? MariaDB offers some unique features and syntax extensions that could make for interesting practice scenarios, plus many organizations are migrating from MySQL to MariaDB and would benefit from hands-on experience with MariaDB-specific functionality.

The interactive sandbox approach is really smart for learning SQL concepts. Thanks for sharing this with the community!

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Spam


No comment recommended - this appears to be promotional content for a database course rather than a genuine technical discussion or question about MariaDB. As a MariaDB Foundation advocate, engaging with course advertisements wouldn't provide value to the community and could appear as endorsing commercial content. Better to focus efforts on posts where users have actual MariaDB-related questions or issues.

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion


No comment recommended - This appears to be a generic MySQL tutorial post rather than a specific MariaDB question or problem. While MariaDB is largely MySQL-compatible, engaging on generic MySQL content without a clear MariaDB angle could be seen as off-topic promotion. Better to focus on posts where users are specifically asking about MariaDB or have technical issues that could benefit from MariaDB expertise.

2026-01-27 09:33 UTC

> Previously used sap hana replicated data from mysql for one report and mssql for another(created crystal reports then). Now is it better to drop hana and use mysql and mssql as datasource to create embedder reports with data paremeters in metabase? Also one report used big table (around 15 mil rows) to summarize data. Will metabase support such load of data? Thinking about free version managed on site. But if there is cheap alternaties could U share your expirience

**AI suggested comment:** Category: General Discussion


This sounds like an interesting reporting architecture challenge! While Metabase is a solid open-source BI tool, I'd encourage you to consider MariaDB as part of your solution. 

For your 15 million row table, MariaDB's ColumnStore engine is specifically designed for analytical workloads and can handle large datasets very efficiently. You could potentially consolidate your MySQL and MSSQL data sources into MariaDB, giving you a single, performant database for reporting. MariaDB also offers excellent compatibility with MySQL, making migration straightforward.

MariaDB works well with various BI tools including Metabase, Grafana, and others. The combination of MariaDB ColumnStore for analytics plus MariaDB Server for transactional data could simplify your architecture while improving performance. Have you considered what your data refresh requirements are for these reports?

**AI suggested comment:** Category: Job Posting


No comment recommended - This is a job seeking post from a fresher looking for opportunities, not a technical question about MariaDB. While the candidate mentions MySQL experience, they're not asking for technical help or discussing MariaDB-related issues that would benefit from a MariaDB Foundation response.

No comment recommended - This appears to be promotional content for a MySQL course that is not directly related to MariaDB. While MariaDB has MySQL compatibility, engaging with promotional posts about MySQL courses would not be appropriate for a MariaDB Foundation representative and could create confusion about the relationship between the two database systems.
